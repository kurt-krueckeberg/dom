<div id="grid-col"><p>Alemannia Aachen 1, Rot-Weiss Essen... </p>
<p>Zero. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Man! </p>
<p>Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and bless what you have given us. </p>
<p>Amen. What about the teaching position? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I didn't go there. </p>
<p>Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That I was not there. </p>
<p>For weeks I beg Hartwig, and you don't even go? </p>
<p>I don't work for a man who supported the Nazis! </p>
<p>On weekends, you help out in the business! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That's where we practice &quot;negro music.&quot; </p>
<p>Forget it, you're working, period! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't treat me like a child! </p>
<p>What’s the matter with you Mattes? Eat something! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not hungry. </p>
<p>But afterwards there's nothing more. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Rot-Weiss Essen lost, Mom. </p>
<p>So what? They always lose. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Bullshit! </p>
<p>It's not so bad after all. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, mama! </p>
<p>Lost 1 0... What a bummer! </p>
<p>And that against Aachen! </p>
<p>What's up, Atze? Come here, it tastes good. You can see that. </p>
<p>Eat Blacky too. </p>
<p>We'll never be German champions in our lifetime. </p>
<p>Day together. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good luck! </p>
<p>That looks good. I need a refill. Smells good! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I still get money for the last time. </p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll collect from the band, then you'll get it. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Band? </p>
<p>'A band. &quot;Band&quot; sounds better. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't forget your homework. </p>
<p>I have already done that. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So, have you digested your defeat yet? </p>
<p>Right. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Christa? </p>
<p>Will you make me another one? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't you have enough already? </p>
<p>One more to go. Say a sentence with &quot;Hamama&quot; and &quot;Hattata&quot;. </p>
<p>&quot;When we went for a bike ride once, it rained there.&quot; </p>
<p>My mom wanted to know when you were going to pay your lid. </p>
<p>Don't get fat here. You're worse than your age. </p>
<p>My old man has been in Russia for 11 years. And as long as that's the case, I'll do the fat one here. So, when? </p>
<p>As soon as I have work. You can count on it. </p>
<p>It's a word. </p>
<p>So. I have to go to practice now. </p>
<p>Handball? </p>
<p>Very funny. </p>
<p>Ouch! Fucking shit! </p>
<p>Are you trying to kill me, fart knot? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Sorry, but we are late! </p>
<p>Late? For what? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>For training. </p>
<p>What day is it today? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tuesday. </p>
<p>What time? </p>
<p>Half past four. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Ok. Fifteen minutes. </p>
<p>Gee, boss, you look terrible. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yesterday was a bit late. </p>
<p>We had... we had a meeting. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>A meeting? About what? </p>
<p>I forgot. </p>
<p>We really need to hurry. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You're a real pest, Mattes. First I am almost stoned and then still rushed. </p>
<p>Can't you ring the bell normally? Your predecessor, Micha, was on his toes! </p>
<p>After every big game he stood there with two bottles of ice-cold beer. </p>
<p>Hey, pellet. Are you offended now? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nah, but... </p>
<p>You might get another carrier if I don't do it well enough. </p>
<p>Don't talk nonsense, Mattes! You're my mascot! </p>
<p>I only win if you're there! </p>
<p>We saw that again in Aachen. </p>
<p>You probably don't think so. But it's true, really. </p>
<p>Whenever you're around, I can always turn the close games around. </p>
<p>Every time! Okay? Come on, then. </p>
<p>Hurry up! Otherwise I'll have to pay 50 pfennigs into the team's coffers. </p>
<p>Exactly. </p>
<p>(music) </p>
<p>Man, man, man! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>How the boss creeps across a square... Old man is not an express-train, Willi. </p>
<p>(Willi) No wonder they lose in Aachen. </p>
<p>Man, man, man! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>My grandma would have sunk it too. </p>
<p>Helmut, you bottle, you can't even hit a furniture truck from 3 meters! </p>
<p>I heard that, Willi! </p>
<p>(music) </p>
<p>Where have you been for so long? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What's wrong? </p>
<p>She didn't want to open it until all the men were there. </p>
<p>And if he is dead? </p>
<p>Soon we will be a real family again. </p>
<p>What? </p>
<p>Are you not happy at all? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, it is. </p>
<p>Now Wewetzer comes through the middle, plays to Paetz, who passes to Kruhl! </p>
<p>He shoots... and goal! Goal! </p>
<p>Goal by Kruhl in the 81st minute! </p>
<p>This is the decision here in Hamburg's Volkspark Stadium! </p>
<p>What's the score? - 4 1. </p>
<p>Not bad. </p>
<p>Yes, but for Hanover. Word of honor! </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What? I don't believe it! </p>
<p>Hannover leads against Kaiserslautern 4 1? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, yes! </p>
<p>And now there are gloating calls here for Sepp Herberger. </p>
<p>Because with FCK loses the team that is the backbone of his national eleven! </p>
<p>Oh dear, this is a difficult hour for the national coach! </p>
<p>It was also a difficult hour for Annette Ackermann, née von Hadding. </p>
<p>Annette... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hello, gentlemen. </p>
<p>Well, are we off already? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>No, of course not. Sorry. </p>
<p>What do you actually have against soccer? </p>
<p>I mean, I'm a sports journalist. </p>
<p>You also have your good sides. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Come with us to the stadium, to 1860! </p>
<p>That's all I needed. Oh, here! </p>
<p>I've been looking for this all the time. </p>
<p>What is it? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Morocco. </p>
<p>Father donates us a honeymoon in addition to the house. </p>
<p>Are you coming? If you have time between two soccer broadcasts. </p>
<p>You proposed, I accepted, and we got married. </p>
<p>True. </p>
<p>Besides, we might as well go to Egypt and see the pyramids. </p>
<p>Is this a vacation or a crusade? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I knew you would be happy. </p>
<p>(music) </p>
<p>Will you take the bread, please? </p>
<p>What if he's not there again? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't drive me crazy! </p>
<p>I'm nervous enough as it is. </p>
<p>If only he's okay. </p>
<p>Who knows what the Russian did to him. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>&quot;The Russian&quot; kicked &quot;the German's&quot;...ass because &quot;the German&quot; attacked him for no reason. </p>
<p>Here! </p>
<p>(music) </p>
<p>Karl-Heinz. </p>
<p>Christa. </p>
<p>I... I am Ingrid. </p>
<p>And who is he? </p>
<p>I had written to you about him. </p>
<p>I never got a letter. </p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that. </p>
<p>Matthias came after you had to go back to the front. </p>
<p>9 months after you had to go back. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You talk when you're asked. </p>
<p>And it's named after my father? </p>
<p>There. That's it! </p>
<p>We closed today because of you, of course. </p>
<p>And it's only five minutes by bike to the colliery. </p>
<p>You're standing behind the counter here? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, and Ingrid helps as a waitress. </p>
<p>And Bruno? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not me. I am a musician. </p>
<p>Musicians! So... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes. </p>
<p>And who is that? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This is the boss. </p>
<p>Actually, his name is Helmut Rahn and... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And plays for Rot-Weiss Essen. </p>
<p>He is even a national player, and he is my best friend. </p>
<p>Soon it will be the World Cup and... </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Your best friend. </p>
<p>I carry his bag and in return I get free entry. </p>
<p>He's kind of a father figure to him. </p>
<p>The children are completely... It's time they learned some real discipline again. </p>
<p>I had so little time for them because of the economy and all.... </p>
<p>That will be different once I have my compensation. </p>
<p>I'll be starting again soon on shaft 4. </p>
<p>I can feed my family myself. </p>
<p>We can then sell the pub. </p>
<p>Give me a little more time, Christa. </p>
<p>Ackermann! Congratulations belatedly. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, Mr. Ahrens. Thank you. </p>
<p>Your wife already in other circumstances? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not yet. But we practice diligently. </p>
<p>Beautiful. But be careful. Women are the natural enemy of soccer. </p>
<p>As the years go by, the nagging becomes less. </p>
<p>Ackermann, I have a problem here. </p>
<p>Yes? </p>
<p>I need a good man for Switzerland. </p>
<p>For the World Cup? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Exactly. </p>
<p>I thought Schwerdtfeger was doing that. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>He's out of Herberger's league. </p>
<p>After the commentary on the Saarland match. </p>
<p>So I need a man down there who has a clean slate and talent to boot. </p>
<p>You mean... me? </p>
<p>And a quick perception. </p>
<p>(music) </p>
<p>Everywhere you look nothing! </p>
<p>Honey! Finally. Help me choose. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I have to tell you something, Annette. The honeymoon falls through. Ahrens ordered me to the World Cup. </p>
<p>That is not true. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This is a unique opportunity. I can't pass it up. </p>
<p><span lang="en-US">Are you telling me in all seriousness that this brawl is more important than the honeymoon with your wife?</span> </p>
<p>24 guys running after a single ball? </p>
<p>22. </p>
<p>22 for all I care. </p>
<p>It would be boring if everyone had a ball. </p>
<p>All right, Ackermann. </p>
<p>What does &quot;All right&quot; mean? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You can drive. </p>
<p>Ah yes? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>On one condition. </p>
<p>And what would that be? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I will come with you. </p>
<p>Come on, pellet, I'll be back soon. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Can't I come with you after all? </p>
<p>You can't sleep under my bed. </p>
<p>I'm in the same room with Fritz Walter. </p>
<p>When you snore, he sleeps badly. And then he plays badly. And then we lose and are eliminated. </p>
<p>Do you want that? </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nope. </p>
<p>You said you can't win the big games without me. </p>
<p>True. Nevertheless, that's not possible. What would your father say? </p>
<p>I would rather have you as my father. </p>
<p>Don't say that, Mattes. Your father's going through a hard time, and he needs you here now. I'm sure things will get better soon. </p>
<p>Good. Then read again, but slowly and to enjoy, yes? </p>
<p>&quot;Dear sports comrades. We are pleased to be able to inform you that we can expect you in good health and well prepared, on Wednesday, 26.5. 1954, at the Munich-Grünwald Sports School. </p>
<p>Players are entitled to loss of earnings only for the time the team is in competition. With sporting regards, i. A. Passler&quot; </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hopefully they have enough mosquitoes with them. </p>
<p>Time to leave. Come. </p>
<p>(locomotive whistle) </p>
<p>Good luck, boss. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You too, fart knot. </p>
<p>(conductor) </p>
<p>Caution, please! </p>
<p>We welcome here in the studio </p>
<p>our national goalkeeper Anton Turek. </p>
<p>He is only called Toni and has brought us something for the benefit of the late returnees... from Russian captivity. </p>
<p>from Russian captivity. Toni. </p>
<p>Yes. I have here </p>
<p>an original World Cup ball. </p>
<p>All comrades of Fortuna Düsseldorf have signed on it. </p>
<p>We hope that a nice sum will come out of it for the homecomers.... </p>
<p>and keep our fingers crossed for all participants from here. </p>
<p>And I would be very happy if one or the other comrade...with your help could find his way again a little easier </p>
<p>in the homeland could find their way. </p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>It doesn't work with the reception! </p>
<p>I'd better return the expensive thing. </p>
<p>If you want to compete with Kessler, you have to keep this thing. </p>
<p>Men are crazy about soccer. </p>
<p>Just take your moronic son. </p>
<p>He thinks Rahn won't win without him. </p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Just not the important games! </p>
<p>...for the last training session before the World Cup finals in Switzerland. </p>
<p>In the storm always in front and so also immediately the first from the bus </p>
<p>Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-Weiss Essen...Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-Weiss Essen...and Berni Klodt from Schalke 04. </p>
<p>Toni Turek from Fortuna Düsseldorf...between Heinz Kubsch from FK Pirmasens </p>
<p>and Heinrich Kwiatkowski from BVB. </p>
<p>Assistant coach Albert Sing sends Ottmar Walter of 1. FCK... </p>
<p>and Herbert Erhard from SpVgg Fürth through the course. </p>
<p>These two will probably go to bed with a buzzing head. </p>
<p>Karlheinz Metzner from KSV Hessen Kassel and Uli Biesinger from BC Augsburg. </p>
<p>At home they are local rivals, but here they strengthen together to really outplay the Magyars </p>
<p>Alfred Pfaff of Eintracht Frankfurt...and Richard Hermann of FSV Frankfurt. </p>
<p>And that will certainly earn the respect of our preliminary round opponents...for sure. Paul Mebus from 1. FC Köln shows his footwork, and teammate Hans Schäfer wants to be in no way inferior to him. </p>
<p>During a cheerful game of cards recover from the exhausting training... </p>
<p>Werner Liebrich, Horst Eckel and Werner Kohlmeyer from Lauter. </p>
<p>The Bavarians are a bit more comfortable. Karl Mai from SpVgg Fürth...and Hans Bauer from Bayern Munich. </p>
