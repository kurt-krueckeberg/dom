<p>Alemannia Aachen 1, Rot-Weiss Essen...</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Man!</p>
<p> Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and bless what you have given us.</p>
<p>Amen. What about the teaching position?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I didn't go there.</p>
<p>Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That I was not there.</p>
<p>For weeks I beg Hartwig, and you don't even go?</p>
<p>I don't work for a man who supported the Nazis!</p>
<p>On weekends, you help out in the business!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>That's where we practice "negro music."</p>
<p>Forget it, you're working, period!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't treat me like a child!</p>
<p>What’s the matter with you Mattes? Eat something!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not hungry.</p>
<p>But afterwards there's nothing more.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Rot-Weiss Essen lost, Mom.</p>
<p>So what? They always lose.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Bullshit!</p>
<p>It's not so bad after all.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, mama!</p>
<p>Lost 1 0... What a bummer!</p>
<p>And that against Aachen!</p>
<p>What's up, Atze? Come here, it tastes good. You can see that.</p>
<p>Eat Blacky too.</p>
<p>We'll never be German champions in our lifetime.</p>
<p>Day together.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good luck!</p>
<p>That looks good. I need a refill. Smells good!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I still get money for the last time.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll collect from the band, then you'll get it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Band?</p>
<p>'A band. "Band" sounds better.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't forget your homework.</p>
<p>I have already done that.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So, have you digested your defeat yet?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Christa?</p>
<p>Will you make me another one?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't you have enough already?</p>
<p>One more to go. Say a sentence with "Hamama" and "Hattata".</p>
<p>"When we went for a bike ride once, it rained there."</p>
<p>My mom wanted to know when you were going to pay your lid.</p>
<p>Don't get fat here.  You're worse than your age.</p>
<p>My old man has been in Russia for 11 years.  And as long as that's the case, I'll do the fat one here.  So, when?</p>
<p>As soon as I have work.  You can count on it.</p>
<p>It's a word.</p>
<p>So. I have to go to practice now.</p>
<p>Handball?</p>
<p>Very funny.</p>
<p>Ouch! Fucking shit!</p>
<p>Are you trying to kill me, fart knot?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Sorry, but we are late!</p>
<p>Late? For what?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>For training.</p>
<p>What day is it today?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Tuesday.</p>
<p>What time?</p>
<p>Half past four.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Ok. Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Gee, boss, you look terrible.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yesterday was a bit late.</p>
<p>We had... we had a meeting.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>A meeting? About what?</p>
<p>I forgot.</p>
<p>We really need to hurry.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You're a real pest, Mattes. First I am almost stoned and then still rushed.</p>
<p>Can't you ring the bell normally? Your predecessor, Micha, was on his toes!</p>
<p>After every big game he stood there with two bottles of ice-cold beer.</p>
<p>Hey, pellet. Are you offended now?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nah, but...</p>
<p>You might get another carrier if I don't do it well enough.</p>
<p>Don't talk nonsense, Mattes! You're my mascot!</p>
<p>I only win if you're there!</p>
<p>We saw that again in Aachen.</p>
<p>You probably don't think so. But it's true, really.</p>
<p> Whenever you're around, I can always turn the close games around.</p>
<p>Every time! Okay? Come on, then.</p>
<p> Hurry up! Otherwise I'll have to pay 50 pfennigs into the team's coffers.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Man, man, man!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>How the boss creeps across a square... Old man is not an express-train, Willi.</p>
<p>(Willi) No wonder they lose in Aachen.</p>
<p>Man, man, man!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>My grandma would have sunk it too.</p>
<p> Helmut, you bottle, you can't even hit a furniture truck from 3 meters!</p>
<p>I heard that, Willi!</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Where have you been for so long?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What's wrong?</p>
<p>She didn't want to open it until all the men were there.</p>
<p>And if he is dead?</p>
<p>Soon we will be a real family again.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Are you not happy at all?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Now Wewetzer comes through the middle, plays to Paetz, who passes to Kruhl!</p>
<p>He shoots... and goal! Goal!</p>
<p>Goal by Kruhl in the 81st minute!</p>
<p>This is the decision here in Hamburg's Volkspark Stadium!</p>
<p>What's the score? - 4 1.</p>
<p>Not bad.</p>
<p>Yes, but for Hanover.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What?</p>
<p>Word of honor!</p>
<p>Hannover leads against Kaiserslautern 4  1?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, yes!</p>
<p>And now there are gloating calls here for Sepp Herberger.</p>
<p>Because with FCK, the team that is the backbone of his national eleven is losing!</p>
<p>Oh dear, this is a difficult hour for the national coach!</p>
<p>It was also a difficult hour for Annette Ackermann, née von Hadding.</p>
<p>Annette...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hello, gentlemen.</p>
<p>Well, are we off already?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>No, of course not. Sorry.</p>
<p>What do you actually have against soccer?</p>
<p>I mean, I'm a sports journalist.</p>
<p>You also have your good side.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Come with us to the stadium, to 1860!</p>
<p>That's all I needed. Oh, here!  I've been looking for this all the time.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What is it?</p>
<p>Morocco.</p>
<p>Father donates us a honeymoon in addition to the house.</p>
<p>Are you coming? If you have time between two soccer broadcasts.</p>
<p>You proposed, I accepted, and we got married.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Besides, we might as well go to Egypt and see the pyramids.</p>
<p>Is this a vacation or a crusade?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I knew you would be happy.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Will you take the bread, please?</p>
<p>What if he's not there again?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Don't drive me crazy!</p>
<p>I'm nervous enough as it is.</p>
<p>If only he's okay.</p>
<p>Who knows what the Russian did to him.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>"The Russian" kicked "the German's"...ass because "the German" attacked him for no reason.</p>
<p>Here!</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Karl-Heinz.</p>
<p>Christa.</p>
<p>I... I am Ingrid.</p>
<p>And who is he?</p>
<p>I had written to you about him.</p>
<p>I never got a letter.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that.</p>
<p>Matthias came after you had to go back to the front.</p>
<p>9 months after you had to go back.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You talk when you're asked.</p>
<p>And it's named after my father?</p>
<p>There. That's it!</p>
<p>We closed today because of you, of course.</p>
<p>And it's only five minutes by bike to the mine.</p>
<p>You're standing behind the counter here?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, and Ingrid helps as a waitress.</p>
<p>And Bruno?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not me. I am a musician.</p>
<p>Musicians! So...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes.</p>
<p>And who is that?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This is the boss.</p>
<p>Actually, his name is Helmut Rahn and...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>And plays for Rot-Weiss Essen.</p>
<p>He is even a national player, and he is my best friend.</p>
<p>Soon it will be the World Cup and...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Your best friend.</p>
<p>I carry his bag and in return I get free entry.</p>
<p>He's kind of a father figure to him.</p>
<p>The children are completely... It's time they learned some real discipline again.</p>
<p>I had so little time for them because of the bar and all....</p>
<p>That will be different once I have my compensation.</p>
<p>I'll be starting again soon on shaft 4.</p>
<p>I can feed my family myself.</p>
<p>We can then sell the pub.</p>
<p>Give me a little more time, Christa.</p>
<p>Ackermann! Congratulations belatedly.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good morning, Mr. Ahrens. Thank you.</p>
<p>Is wife already in other circumstances?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Not yet. But we practice diligently.</p>
<p> Beautiful. But be careful. Women are the natural enemy of soccer.</p>
<p>As the years go by, the nagging becomes less.</p>
<p>Ackermann, I have a problem here.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>I need a good man for Switzerland.</p>
<p>For the World Cup?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Exactly.</p>
<p>I thought Schwerdtfeger was doing that.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>He's out of Herberger's league.</p>
<p>After the commentary on the Saarland match.</p>
<p>So I need a man down there who has a clean slate and talent to boot.</p>
<p>You mean... me?</p>
<p>And a quick wit.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Everywhere you look nothing!</p>
<p>Honey! Finally. Help me choose.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I have to tell you something, Annette.  The honeymoon falls through. Ahrens ordered me to the World Cup.</p>
<p>That is not true.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>This is a unique opportunity. I can't pass it up.</p>
<p>Are you telling me in all seriousness that this brawl is more important than the honeymoon with your wife?</p>
<p>24 guys running after a single ball?</p>
<p>22.</p>
<p>22 for all I care.</p>
<p>It would be boring if everyone had a ball.</p>
<p>All right, Ackermann.</p>
<p>What does "All right" mean?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You can drive.</p>
<p>Ah yes?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>On one condition.</p>
<p>And what would that be?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I will come with you.</p>
<p>Come on, pellet, I'll be back soon.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Can't I come with you after all?</p>
<p>You can't sleep under my bed.</p>
<p>I'm in the same room with Fritz Walter.</p>
<p>When you snore, he sleeps badly. And then he plays badly. And then we lose and are eliminated.</p>
<p>Do you want that?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nope.</p>
<p>You said you can't win the big games without me.</p>
<p> True. Nevertheless, that's not possible. What would your father say?</p>
<p>I would rather have you as my father.</p>
<p> "Dear sports comrades. We are pleased to be able to inform you that we can expect you in good health and well prepared, on Wednesday, 26.5. 1954, at the Munich-Grünwald Sports School.</p>
<p>Players are entitled to loss of earnings only for the time the team is in competition. With sporting regards, i. A. Passler"</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Hopefully they have enough mosquitoes with them.</p>
<p>Time to leave. Come.</p>
<p>(locomotive whistle)</p>
<p>Good luck, boss.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You too, fart knot.</p>
<p>(conductor)</p>
<p>Caution, please!</p>
<p>We welcome here in the studio our national goalkeeper Anton Turek.</p>
<p>He is only called Toni and has brought us something for the benefit of the late returnees...from Russian captivity. Toni.</p>
<p>Yes. I have here an original World Cup ball.</p>
<p>All the fellows of Fortuna Düsseldorf have signed on it.</p>
<p>We hope that a nice sum will come out of it for the homecomers....and keep our fingers crossed for all participants from here.</p>
<p>And I would be very happy if one or the other fellow...with your help could find his way again a little easier in the homeland.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It doesn't work with the reception!</p>
<p>I'd better return the expensive thing.</p>
<p>If you want to compete with Kessler, you have to keep this thing.</p>
<p>Men are crazy about soccer. Just take your moronic son.</p>
<p>He thinks Rahn won't win without him.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Just not the important games!</p>
<p>...for the last training session before the World Cup finals in Switzerland.</p>
<p>In the storm always in front and so also immediately the first from the bus</p>
<p>Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-Weiss Essen...Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-Weiss Essen...and Berni Klodt from Schalke 04.</p>
<p>Toni Turek from Fortuna Düsseldorf...between Heinz Kubsch from FK Pirmasens and Heinrich Kwiatkowski from BVB.</p>
<p>Assistant coach Albert Sing sends Ottmar Walter of 1. FCK...</p>
<p>and Herbert Erhard from SpVgg Fürth through the course.</p>
<p>These two will probably go to bed with a buzzing head.</p>
<p>Karlheinz Metzner from KSV Hessen Kassel and Uli Biesinger from BC Augsburg.</p>
<p>At home they are local rivals, but here they strengthen each other to really overturn the Hungarians.</p>
<p>Alfred Pfaff of Eintracht Frankfurt...and Richard Hermann of FSV Frankfurt.</p>
<p>And that will certainly earn the respect of our preliminary round opponents...for sure. Paul Mebus from 1. FC Köln shows his footwork, and teammate Hans Schäfer wants to be in no way inferior to him.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a cheerful game of cards Werner Liebrich, Horst Eckel and Werner Kohlmeyer from Lauter recover from the exhausting training...</p>
<p>The Bavarians are a bit more comfortable. Karl Mai from SpVgg Fürth...and Hans Bauer from Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Fritz Laband and Jupp Posipal, both of HSV, are currently completing what is probably the most pleasant training session: that of signing autographs.</p>
<p>But isn't there another one missing?</p>
<p>Of course, the captain! And there he is: Fritz Walter from 1. FC Kaiserslautern.</p>
<p>Bravo, Mr. Walter.</p>
<p>Smile for me. There you go.</p>
<p>And here once again the entire squad.</p>
<p>Good luck, guys!</p>
<p>The homeland is keeping its fingers crossed for you.</p>
<p>Welcome home, Richard.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Thank you.</p>
<p>It's good to have you back.</p>
<p>A lot has changed down here.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Good luck.</p>
<p>(Richard screams)</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Men, in two weeks in Switzerland we want to look good &lbrack;literally&ndash;make a good impression&rbrack;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I still see glaring physical deficiencies in some of you.</p>
<p>So we will do more exercises&lbrack;gymnastics&rbrack;.</p>
<p>We start with push-ups.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>You see, you have to work on yourselves.</p>
<p>Use the course to train hard.</p>
<p> Work on your weaknesses, but also train what you can.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Oh, how soon beauty and form fade away."</p>
<p>You are not beautiful, so at least fight for the rest.</p>
<p>By the way, Metzner, you are an outstanding soccer player.</p>
<p>But you smoke secretly, and by doing so you betray your comrades.</p>
<p>Because you would have played even better otherwise.</p>
<p>So I want you to pack up and go home.</p>
<p>Wasn't that a bit harsh?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Of course. He's still allowed to stay, but they have to know where they're going.</p>
<p>Now let's see what you've got, Adi.</p>
<p>Is lighter than its predecessor.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>True. But it is not.</p>
<p>Don't make it so exciting.</p>
<p>Screws...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Exactly. Studs with screw thread.</p>
<p>Screws!</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>The right length (of replaceble cleat) for any weather.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, they fit perfectly. Of course they do.</p>
<p>They are screwed on.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>I want two complete sets for the world championship!</p>
<p> Listen carefully. I hereby forbid you to have any contact with soldiers.</p>
<p>I haven't done anything. I just wanted to go with a friend....</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I forbid you to get all dolled up.</p>
<p>That's not true. I just wanted to...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>As long as you live under my roof, there are certain rules for you.</p>
<p>You'll abide by them, right?</p>
<p>(Peter)</p>
<p>Tip, top, tip, tip.</p>
<p>Good, then I'll take the Lang.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Then Akki and Nolden come to me.</p>
<p>Then we take the Mischa and the Buri.</p>
<p>I will then take the Rainer and the Carola.</p>
<p>And you still get the Lubanski.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nah, we get Carola and her Mattes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But next time you'll get this.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Hey! You're playing with us, man!</p>
<p>Goal!</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Set with "x".</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>It was probably nothing.</p>
<p>Mom said you used to play soccer too.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nope.</p>
<p>I am also only allowed to play if they are odd.</p>
<p>The girl was not bad at all.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Carola. I can never get past her, not even with the best tricks from the boss.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Because you can't play like that.</p>
<p> You imitate his tricks, his style, but it's not your style.</p>
<p>And what is my style?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You're tough and you can run.</p>
<p>You run more than the others.</p>
<p>You are a defender.</p>
<p>No one will respect the bad copy of a star.</p>
<p>(vocals)</p>
<p>Werner Liebrich, Werner Liebrich, are you still sleeping?</p>
<p>Are you still asleep?</p>
<p>Do you not hear the bells?</p>
<p>Do you not hear the bells?</p>
<p>Ding, ding, dong.</p>
<p>Ding, ding, dong.</p>
<p> Is that a breeze. They should do that in cans and send it.</p>
<p>And if you run out of steam in the game, open up a little can (of it), Kohli.</p>
<p>Look at the boats there, you can sail around on the lake.</p>
<p>These are pedal-boats, Otto, not little boats.</p>
<p>You'll only find them in Kaiserslautern.</p>
<p>Berni, the Hungarians train on the same field as we do!</p>
<p>Really? Us and the defending champion!</p>
<p>(Rahn) Guys, I'm starting to get the tingles.</p>
<p>Your wife put it together so nicely and you stuff it in the closet like that!</p>
<p>How do you distinguish old from fresh?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>I smell it. How do you do that?</p>
<p>There you go! The Swiss can not only build watches.</p>
<p> What does the boss want to punish me for, being in the room with you?</p>
<p>Do you think he'll take me to the first game against the Turks? I'm in top shape.</p>
<p>Here we go again?</p>
<p>All right. Yes, he'll take you.</p>
<p>Berni Klodt is also in good shape.</p>
<p>Maybe he'll take him.</p>
<p>Yes, you're right. He takes Berni.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm going to take a shower.</p>
<p>Funny guy.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Let me guess. You don't like it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Well, soccer reporters...</p>
<p>I always associate it with misery.</p>
<p>The suite was booked for Schwerdtfeger.</p>
<p>I am sure that otherwise I would have been accommodated under a bridge. - Oh well.</p>
<p>So, the opening match will be between Yugoslavia and France? - Yes.</p>
<p>And who do we support?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>As reporters, we have to be neutral.</p>
<p>And with Germany against Turkey?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Of course, we stand by Germany in this respect.</p>
<p>Aren't we reporters there?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Isn't that a bit irrational?</p>
<p>Can be, yes.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Like me sometimes?</p>
<p>Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...now and at the hour of our death.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Gentlemen, here we go at last.</p>
<p>We are playing against Turkey.</p>
<p>The Turks have knocked out Spain in the qualifiers.</p>
<p>So we must not underestimate them.</p>
<p>Let's move on to the lineup.</p>
<p>Toni, you play in goal.</p>
<p>In the defensive line: Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer, in the halfback line: Eckel and Mai, in the half positions: Morlock and Fritz, in the forward on the left Hans Schäfer, in the center Ottmar, on the right outside...Berni Klodt. Departure is in two hours.</p>
<p>I expect punctuality.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Goal! 4 1 won!</p>
<p>Well played, Matthias.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Lubanski, that the government pays compensation to the war returnees is correct. But your number of years is not correct.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nope. You don't make a mistake with that (of the number of years imprisoned).  11 years and 4 months.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>According to my records, you were sentenced in the Soviet Republic for aggravated theft and sabotage for additional years. This can then no longer be counted as a prisoner of war. And so you have no further entitlement to compensation for this period. :</p>
<p>We stole a can of brown sugar because we were dying!</p>
<p>I don't doubt that, Mr Lubanski. However, that doesn't change the facts.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of us starved to death. : Hundreds I was allowed to watch! Sabotage, theft, it was all a joke!</p>
<p>I didn't make the rules.</p>
<p>And you are not the first to complain. At the same time, you can still be glad that...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Be happy? I can be happy? You know who can be happy? You! Because you haven't spent a day in Russia! And you can be glad that I don't beat your face in!</p>
<p>The Hungarians seem surprised by the lineup of the German team, but they will care little.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>50 penny.</p>
<p>What, pay admission?</p>
<p>You take it from the living.</p>
<p>(TV commentary continues)</p>
<p>Well? Everything clear?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Nothing is clear at all.</p>
<p>Herberger lets the substitutes play.</p>
<p>Careless ball...</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Goal!</p>
<p>I knew it. I knew it!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What a shit!</p>
<p>Why doesn't Kwiatkowski not hold on to the ball? - Matthias?</p>
<p>Will you come here?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>A very bad start!</p>
<p>Go ahead and sit down.</p>
<p>Can you sell me a cigarette?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Right.</p>
<p>Here, I give you.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>I saw you there in the church.</p>
<p>You lit a candle.</p>
<p>Will you also tell me for whom?</p>
<p>Come on, say it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>For Helmut Rahn.</p>
<p>Helmut Rahn?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Herberger usually does not field him.</p>
<p>That's when I thought I had to do something.</p>
<p>Come outside.</p>
<p>You light a candle in church, just so some ball kicker can...</p>
<p>doesn't have to sit on the bench?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Rahn is not just some ball kicker!</p>
<p>He is the best!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Are you crazy? You are abusing the church!</p>
<p>Off home!</p>
<p>Think about the meaning of the church!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>But...</p>
<p>Stop it now. And don't you start crying!</p>
<p>A German boy does not cry.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>None of your business.</p>
<p>One may well still ask.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Shut up and get back inside. Go!</p>
<p>(Sad Music)</p>
<p>Did you hear that?</p>
<p>"A German boy does not cry."</p>
<p>I wish he had never come back.</p>
<p>Come on, Alfred, hurry up! Come down!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes.</p>
<p>8  3.</p>
<p>What an embarrassment.</p>
<p>And only Herberger is to blame!</p>
<p>I don't know what's wrong with you.</p>
<p>I think it's very clever.</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Yes, he is sparing his important people for the decisive match against the Turks.</p>
<p>That's what I would have done.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Well, if that doesn't make Seppl happy...</p>
<p>Another cold drink?</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Three pilsners. And three in stock!</p>
<p>Do not look. These are players from the German national team.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>They drink one, just like us.</p>
<p>Do you think Herberger will let them go on a booze cruise during the tournament?</p>
<p>Oh! You mean they escaped?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes.</p>
<p> Let's dance unobtrusively a little closer so we can hear what they're saying.</p>
<p>Eight pieces! And?</p>
<p>How do you feel about being a stopgap?</p>
<p>We were good enough for the dirty work, but watch out...</p>
<p>...Next time they will do without us.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You still have it good.</p>
<p>At least everyone scored a goal.</p>
<p>I only got myself a few bruises.</p>
<p>Still can't perform properly.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>So what? Let's wash down the aggravation.</p>
<p> But right. Must be worth it if the old man catches us. Cheers.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>(Sings)</p>
<p>Home we will not go...</p>
<p>My God, he's heavy!</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>These are the muscles.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Just look at those thighs.</p>
<p>Every single muscle is trained there.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Yes, yes. It's okay.</p>
<p>Who are you, buddy?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Ackermann, Süddeutsche Zeitung.</p>
<p>Great sports section.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Thank you.</p>
<p>And you, madam?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>His wife.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p>We'll leave him here and get out of here.</p>
<p>And we'll call the doorman, honey.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they'll drag us into it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What thighs.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>What a story.</p>
<p>Dare or I'll divorce you.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Then I dare.</p>
<p>(music)</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Herberger.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Greetings.</p>
<p>Sorry, I was just cleaning.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if you did not run over it.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Cleaning at this hour?</p>
<p>When else?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'> May I sit here until the ground is dry?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Sure.</p>
<p>Did you lose today?</p>
<p>And how!</p>
<p>And you are no longer in the competition?</p>
<p>Yes. We lost a battle, not the war.</p>
<p>Tell me, young lady, do you have children?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Me?</p>
<p>Nine pieces! And you?</p>
<p>22. And one of them gives me great trouble.</p>
<p>Surely your favorite child.</p>
<p>They always make the most trouble.</p>
<p> That makes it especially difficult to punish him.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Oh, nonsense.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>Garbage. Rubbish. Absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>You are not in Germany now, there is no need to punish all the time.</p>
<p>Whoever is not for me is against me.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>You also have to let 5 be straight sometimes.</p>
<p>No pain no gain.</p>
<p>When the apple is ripe, it falls from the tree by itself.</p>
<p>Early bird catches the worm.</p>
<p class='new-speaker'>The ball is round, and a game lasts 90 minutes.</p>
