# DOM Introduction

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a web page. It is also a set of
interfaces for accessing these objects and for manipulating them.

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making
the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Even if most web developers will only use the DOM through JavaScript,
implementations of the DOM can be built for any language such as PHP's DOMDocument, DOMXPath and SimpleXMLElement APIs.

## The DOM Data Types

The data types are:

* Document
* Node
* Element
* NodeList
* Attr
* NamedNodeMap
