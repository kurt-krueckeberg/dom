<h1>PHP Data Structures Extension</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ds.php">PHP Data Structures Extension</a> for <strong>PHP 7</strong> provides the solutions and improved performance of classical data structures and is a nice alternative to PHP's one-fize-fits-all <code>array</code>.
The classes&mdash;of Vector, Deque, Map, Set, Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue and Pair&mdash;and their interfaces&mdash;Collection, Hashable and Sequence&mdash;are explained in <a href="https://medium.com/@rtheunissen/efficient-data-structures-for-php-7-9dda7af674cd">Efficient Data Structures for PHP</a>
written by extension's author. They are also discussed in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/b6ffs5/who_here_uses_ds_data_structures_and_for_which/">Reddit thread</a>.</p>

<p>Answers to questions can be found at the end of the <strong>Ds</strong> github repository <a href="https://github.com/php-ds/ext-ds">README</a>.</p>

<p>There is also another&mdash;I believe&mdash;related extension, <a href="https://github.com/php-ds/polyfill">polyfill</a>. </p>

<h3>The Collection Interface</h3>

<p>The Collection interface covers functionality common to all the data structures in this library. It guarantees that all structures are <em>traversable</em>, <em>countable</em>, and can be converted to json using <em>json_encode()</em>, and it thereby <br>
provides support for <em>foreach</em>, <em>echo</em>, <em>count</em>, <em>print_r</em>, <em>var_dump</em>, <em>serialize</em>, <em>json_encode</em>, and <em>clone</em>.</p>

<h2>Importanat Comment on Installation</h2>

<p>If you are using <strong>nginx</strong>, you will need to restart the PHP Fascgi process: </p>

<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm
</code></pre>
