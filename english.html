 Alemannia Aachen 1, Rot-WeissEssen...
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 - Man!
</p>
<p>
Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and bless what you have given us.
</p>
<p>
 Amen. What about the teachingposition?
</p>
<p>
 - I didn't go there.
</p>
<p>
 Excuse me? What is thatsupposed to mean?
</p>
<p>
 - That I was not there.
</p>
<p>
 For weeks Ibeg Hartwig, and you don't even go?
</p>
<p>
 Idon't work for a man who supported the Nazis!
</p>
<p>
 On weekends, you help outin the business!
</p>
<p>
 - That's where we practice&quot;negro music.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Forget it, you're working, period!
</p>
<p>
 - Don't treat me like a child!
</p>
<p>
 What’s the matter with youMattes? Eat something!
</p>
<p>
 - Not hungry.
</p>
<p>
 But afterwards there's nothing more.
</p>
<p>
 - Rot-Weiss Essen lost, Mom.
</p>
<p>
 So what? They always lose.
</p>
<p>
 - Bullshit!
</p>
<p>
 It's not so bad after all.
</p>
<p>
 - Oh, mama!
</p>
<p>
 0 verloren... So 'n Mist! : Lost 1 : 0... What a bummer!
</p>
<p>
 And that against Aachen!
</p>
<p>
 What'sup, Atze? Come here, it tastes good. You can see that.
</p>
<p>
 Eats Blacky too.
</p>
<p>
 We'll never be German championsin our lifetime.
</p>
<p>
 Day together.
</p>
<p>
 - Good luck!
</p>
<p>
That looks good. I need a refill. Smells good!
</p>
<p>
 - I still get money for thelast time.
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow I'll collect from the band, thenyou'll get it.
</p>
<p>
 Band?
</p>
<p>
 'A band. &quot;Band&quot;sounds better.
</p>
<p>
 - Don't forget your homework.
</p>
<p>
 I have already done that.
</p>
<p>
 - So, have you digested your defeatyet?
</p>
<p>
 Right.
</p>
<p>
 - Christa?
</p>
<p>
 Will you make me another one?
</p>
<p>
 - Don't you have enough already?
</p>
<p>
 One more to go. Say a sentence with &quot;Hamama&quot; and&quot;Hattata&quot;.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Whenwe went for a bike ride once, it rained there.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 My mom wantedto know when you were going to pay your lid.
</p>
<p>
 Don'tget fat here.  You're worse than your age.
</p>
<p>
 My old man has been in Russiafor 11 years.  And as long as that's the case, I'll do the fat onehere.  So, when?
</p>
<p>
 As soon as I havework.  You can count on it.
</p>
<p>
 It's a word.
</p>
<p>
 So. I have to go to practice now.
</p>
<p>
 Handball?
</p>
<p>
 Very funny.
</p>
<p>
 Ouch! Fucking shit!
</p>
<p>
 Are you trying to kill me, fartknot?
</p>
<p>
 - Sorry, but we arelate!
</p>
<p>
 Late? For what?
</p>
<p>
 - For training.
</p>
<p>
 What day is it today?
</p>
<p>
 Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
 What time?
</p>
<p>
 Half past four.
</p>
<p>
 - Ok. Fifteen minutes.
</p>
<p>
 Gee, boss, you look terrible.
</p>
<p>
 - Yesterday was a bitlate.
</p>
<p>
 We had... we had a meeting.
</p>
<p>
 - A meeting? About what?
</p>
<p>
 I forgot.
</p>
<p>
 We really need to hurry.
</p>
<p>
 - You're a real pest, Mattes. First I amalmost stoned and then still rushed.
</p>
<p>
 Can't you ring the bell normally? Your predecessor, Micha,was on his toes!
</p>
<p>
 After every big game he stood there with two bottles ofice-cold beer.
</p>
<p>
 Hey, pellet. Are you offendednow?
</p>
<p>
 - Nah, but...
</p>
<p>
 You might get another carrier if I don't do it wellenough.
</p>
<p>
 Don'ttalk nonsense, Mattes! You're my mascot!
</p>
<p>
 I only win if you're there!
</p>
<p>
 We saw that again in Aachen.
</p>
<p>
 You probably don't think so.But it's true, really.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you're around, I can always turn the close games around.
</p>
<p>
 Every time! Okay? Come on, then.
</p>
<p>
Hurry up! Otherwise I'll have to pay 50 pfennigs into the team'scoffers.
</p>
<p>
 Exactly.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Man, man, man!
</p>
<p>
 How the boss sneaks across a square... Old man is not aD-train, Willi.
</p>
<p>
 (Willi) No wonderthey lose in Aachen.
</p>
<p>
 Man, man, man!
</p>
<p>
 My grandma would have sunk ittoo.
</p>
<p>
Helmut, you bottle, you can't even hit a furniture truck from 3meters!
</p>
<p>
 I heard that, Willi!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Where have you been for so long?
</p>
<p>
 What's wrong?
</p>
<p>
 Shedidn't want to open it until all the men were there.
</p>
<p>
 And if he is dead?
</p>
<p>
 Soon we will be areal family again.
</p>
<p>
 What?
</p>
<p>
 Are you not happy at all?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, it is.
</p>
<p>
 Now Wewetzer comes through the middle, plays to Paetz, whopasses to Kruhl!
</p>
<p>
 He shoots... and goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 Goal by Kruhl in the 81st minute!
</p>
<p>
 This isthe decision here in Hamburg's Volkspark Stadium!
</p>
<p>
 1. : What's the score? - 4 : 1.
</p>
<p>
 Not bad.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, but for Hanover. Word ofhonor!
</p>
<p>
 What? I don't believe it!
</p>
<p>
 1? : Hannover leads againstKaiserslautern 4 : 1?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, yes!
</p>
<p>
 Andnow there are gloating calls here for Sepp Herberger.
</p>
<p>
 Because with FCK loses the team that is thebackbone of his national eleven!
</p>
<p>
 Oh dear,this is a difficult hour for the national coach!
</p>
<p>
It was also a difficult hour for Annette Ackermann, née vonHadding.
</p>
<p>
 Annette...
</p>
<p>
 Hello, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
 Well, are we off already?
</p>
<p>
 No, of course not. Sorry.
</p>
<p>
 What do you actually haveagainst soccer?
</p>
<p>
 I mean, I'm a sports journalist.
</p>
<p>
 You also have your good sides.
</p>
<p>
 Come with us to thestadium, to 1860!
</p>
<p>
 That's all I needed. Oh, here!
</p>
<p>
 I've been looking for this allthe time.
</p>
<p>
 What is it?
</p>
<p>
 Morocco.
</p>
<p>
 Fatherdonates us a honeymoon in addition to the house.
</p>
<p>
 Are you coming? If you have time between two soccer broadcasts.
</p>
<p>
You proposed, I accepted, and we got married.
</p>
<p>
 True.
</p>
<p>
Besides, we might as well go to Egypt and see the pyramids.
</p>
<p>
 Is this a vacation or a crusade?
</p>
<p>
 I knew you would be happy.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Will you take the bread, please?
</p>
<p>
 What if he's not there again?
</p>
<p>
 Don't drive me crazy!
</p>
<p>
 I'm nervous enough as it is.
</p>
<p>
 If only he's okay.
</p>
<p>
 Who knows what the Russiandid to him.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;The Russian&quot; kicked &quot;the German's&quot;...assbecause &quot;the German&quot; attacked him for no reason.
</p>
<p>
 Here!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Karl-Heinz.
</p>
<p>
 Christa.
</p>
<p>
 I... I am Ingrid.
</p>
<p>
 And who is he?
</p>
<p>
 I had written to you about him.
</p>
<p>
 I never got a letter.
</p>
<p>
 I'm sorry to hear that.
</p>
<p>
 Matthias came afteryou had to go back to the front.
</p>
<p>
 9 months after you had to goback.
</p>
<p>
 You talk when you're asked.
</p>
<p>
 And it's named after my father?
</p>
<p>
 There. That's it!
</p>
<p>
 We closed todaybecause of you, of course.
</p>
<p>
 And it'sonly five minutes by bike to the colliery.
</p>
<p>
 You're standing behind the counterhere?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, and Ingrid helps as awaitress.
</p>
<p>
 And Bruno?
</p>
<p>
 Not me. I am a musician.
</p>
<p>
 Musicians! So...
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 And who is that?
</p>
<p>
 This is the boss.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, his name is Helmut Rahnand...
</p>
<p>
 And plays for Rot-Weiss Essen.
</p>
<p>
 He iseven a national player, and he is my best friend.
</p>
<p>
 Soon it will be the World Cup and...
</p>
<p>
 Your best friend.
</p>
<p>
 I carry his bagand in return I get free entry.
</p>
<p>
 He's kind of a father figure tohim.
</p>
<p>
 The children are completely... It's time theylearned some real discipline again.
</p>
<p>
 I had so little time for them because of the economy and all....
</p>
<p>
 That will bedifferent once I have my compensation.
</p>
<p>
 I'll be starting again soon onshaft 4.
</p>
<p>
 I can feed my family myself.
</p>
<p>
 We can then sell the pub.
</p>
<p>
 Give me a little more time,Christa.
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann! Congratulations belatedly.
</p>
<p>
 Good morning, Mr. Ahrens. Thankyou.
</p>
<p>
 Your wife already in othercircumstances?
</p>
<p>
 Not yet. But we practicediligently.
</p>
<p>
Beautiful. But be careful. Women are the natural enemy of soccer.
</p>
<p>
 As the years go by, thenagging becomes less.
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann, I have a problem here.
</p>
<p>
 Yes?
</p>
<p>
 I need a good man forSwitzerland.
</p>
<p>
 For the World Cup?
</p>
<p>
 Exactly.
</p>
<p>
 I thought Schwerdtfeger wasdoing that.
</p>
<p>
 He's out of Herberger'sleague.
</p>
<p>
 After the commentary on theSaarland match.
</p>
<p>
 So I need a man down there who has a clean slate andtalent to boot.
</p>
<p>
 You mean... me?
</p>
<p>
 And a quick perception.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Everywhere you look nothing!
</p>
<p>
 Honey! Finally. Help me choose.
</p>
<p>
 I have to tell yousomething, Annette.  The honeymoon falls through. Ahrens ordered meto the World Cup.
</p>
<p>
 That is not true.
</p>
<p>
 This is a unique opportunity. I can't pass it up.
</p>
<p>
 <span lang="en-US">Areyou telling me in all seriousness that this brawl is more importantthan the honeymoon with your wife?</span>
</p>
<p>
 24 guys runningafter a single ball?
</p>
<p>
 22.
</p>
<p>
 22 for all I care.
</p>
<p>
 It would be boringif everyone had a ball.
</p>
<p>
 All right, Ackermann.
</p>
<p>
 What does &quot;All right&quot; mean?
</p>
<p>
 You can drive.
</p>
<p>
 Ah yes?
</p>
<p>
 On one condition.
</p>
<p>
 And what would that be?
</p>
<p>
 I will come with you.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, pellet, I'll be backsoon.
</p>
<p>
 Can't I come with you after all?
</p>
<p>
 You can't sleep under my bed.
</p>
<p>
 I'm in the same room withFritz Walter.
</p>
<p>
 When you snore, he sleepsbadly. And then he plays badly. And then we lose and are eliminated.
</p>
<p>
 Do you want that?
</p>
<p>
 - Nope.
</p>
<p>
 You said you can't win the big games without me.
</p>
<p>
True. Nevertheless, that's not possible. What would your father say?
</p>
<p>
 I would rather have you as myfather.
</p>
<p>
 Don't say that, Mattes. Your father's going through a hardtime, and he needs you here now. I'm sure things will get bettersoon.
</p>
<p>
 Good.Then read again, but slowly and to enjoy, yes?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 Good luck, boss.

<p>
 You too, fart knot.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 We welcome here in the studio
</p>

</p>
<p>
 Yes. I have here
</p>
<p>
 an original World Cup ball.
</p>
<p>
All comrades of Fortuna Düsseldorf have signed on it.
</p>
<p>
 We hope that a nice sum will come out of it forthe homecomers....
</p>
<p>
 andkeep our fingers crossed for all participants from here.
</p>
<p>
 And I would bevery happy if one or the other comrade...with your help could findhis way again a little easier
</p>
<p>
 in the homeland could findtheir way.
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 It doesn't work with the reception!
</p>
<p>
 I'd better return theexpensive thing.
</p>
<p>
If you want to compete with Kessler, you have to keep this thing.
</p>
<p>
 Men are crazy about soccer.
</p>
<p>
 Just take your moronic son.
</p>
<p>
 He thinks Rahn won't winwithout him.
</p>
<p>
 Just not the important games!
</p>
<p>
 ...for thelast training session before the World Cup finals in Switzerland.

</p>
<p>
 Thesetwo will probably go to bed with a buzzing head.
</p>
<p>
Karlheinz Metzner from KSV Hessen Kassel and Uli Biesinger from BCAugsburg.
</p>
<p>
 At home they are localrivals, but here they strengthen together to really outplay theMagyars :
</p>
<p>
 Alfred Pfaff of Eintracht Frankfurt...and RichardHermann of FSV Frankfurt.
</p>
<p>
Paul Mebus vom 1. FC Köln zeigt seine Fußfertigkeit, undMannschaftskamerad Hans Schäfer will ihm da in nichts nachstehen. :And that will certainly earn the respect of our preliminary roundopponents...for sure : Paul Mebus from 1. FC Köln shows hisfootwork, and teammate Hans Schäfer wants to be in no way inferiorto him.
</p>
<p>
 During a cheerful game of cards recover from theexhausting training...
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 But isn't there another one missing?
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter vom 1. FCKaiserslautern. : Of course, the captain! And there he is : FritzWalter from 1. FC Kaiserslautern.
</p>
<p>

<p>
 Good luck, guys!
</p>
<p>
 The homeland keeps its fingerscrossed for you.
</p>
<p>
 Welcome home, Richard.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 It's good to have you back.
</p>
<p>
 A lot has changed down here.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck.
</p>
<p>
 (Screams)
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Men, in two weeks in Switzerland we want to make a goodimpression.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I still see glaring physical deficiencies in some ofyou.
</p>
<p>
 So we will do more gymnastics.
</p>
<p>
 We start with push-ups.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 You see, you have to work onyourselves.
</p>
<p>
 Use the course to trainhard.
</p>
<p>
Work on your weaknesses, but also train what you can.
</p>
<p>
 &quot; Ach, wie bald schwinden Schönheit und Gestalt.&quot;: As the saying goes, &quot; Oh, how soon beauty and form fadeaway.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Beautifulyou are not, so at least fight for the rest.
</p>
<p>
 'brigens,Metzner, you are an outstanding soccer player.
</p>
<p>
 Butyou smoke secretly, and by doing so you betray your comrades.
</p>
<p>
 Because you would be evenbetter otherwise.
</p>
<p>
 That is why you are still goinghome today.
</p>
<p>
 Wasn't that a bit harsh?
</p>
<p>
 Of course. He's still allowed to stay, but they haveto know where they're going.
</p>
<p>
 Now let's see what you've got, Adi.
</p>
<p>
 Is lighter than its predecessor.
</p>
<p>
 True. But it is not.
</p>
<p>
 Don't make it so exciting.
</p>
<p>
 Screws...
</p>
<p>
 Exactly. Studs with screwthread.
</p>
<p>
 Screws!
</p>
<p>
 Brilliant!
</p>
<p>
 The right length for anyweather.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, yes, they fit perfectly.Of course they do.
</p>
<p>
 They are screwed on.
</p>
<p>
 So?
</p>
<p>
 I want two complete sets
</p>
<p>
 for the world championship!
</p>
<p>
Listen carefully. I hereby forbid you to have any contact withsoldiers.
</p>
<p>
 But I just wanted to go witha friend....
</p>
<p>
 I forbid you to get alldolled up.
</p>
<p>
 That's not true. I just wantedto...
</p>
<p>
 As long as you live under my roof, there are certainrules for you.
</p>
<p>
 You'll abide by them, right?
</p>
<p>
 (Peter)
</p>
<p>
 Tip, top, tip, tip.
</p>
<p>
 Good, then I'll take the Lang.
</p>
<p>
 Then Akki and Nolden come tome.
</p>
<p>
 Then we take the Mischaand the Buri.
</p>
<p>
 I will then take theRainer and the Carola.
</p>
<p>
 And you still get the Lubanski.
</p>
<p>
 Nah, we get Carola andher Mattes.
</p>
<p>
 All right.
</p>
<p>
 But next time you'll get this.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Hey! You're playing with us, man!
</p>
<p>
 Goal!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Set with &quot;x&quot;.
</p>
<p>
 It was probably nothing.
</p>
<p>
 Mom said youused to play soccer too.
</p>
<p>
 Nope.
</p>
<p>
 I am alsoonly allowed to play if they are odd.
</p>
<p>
 The girl was not bad at all.
</p>
<p>
 Carola. I can never get past her, not even with thebest tricks from the boss.
</p>
<p>
 Because you can't play likethat.
</p>
<p>
You imitate his tricks, his style, but it's not your style.
</p>
<p>
 And what is my style?
</p>
<p>
 You're tough and you can run.
</p>
<p>
 You run more than the others.
</p>
<p>
 You are a defender.
</p>
<p>
 No onewill respect the bad copy of a star.
</p>
<p>
 (vocals)
</p>
<p>
 Werner Liebrich,Werner Liebrich, are you still sleeping?
</p>
<p>
 Are you still asleep?
</p>
<p>
 Do you not hear the bells?
</p>
<p>
 Do you not hear the bells?
</p>
<p>
 Ding, ding, dong.
</p>
<p>
 Ding, ding, dong.
</p>
<p>
Is that a breeze. They should do that in cans and send it.
</p>
<p>
 And if you run out of steam in the game, open up a snooze,Kohli.
</p>
<p>
 Lookat the boats there, you can sail around on the lake.
</p>
<p>
 These are pedalos, ottes,not boats.
</p>
<p>
 You'll only find them inKaiserslautern.
</p>
<p>
 Berni, theUrus train on the same field as we do!
</p>
<p>
 Really? Us and the defendingchampion!
</p>
<p>
 (Rahn) Guys, I'mstarting to get the tingles.
</p>
<p>
 Your wife put it together so nicely and you stuff it inthe closet like that!
</p>
<p>
 How do you distinguish oldfrom fresh?
</p>
<p>
 I smell it. How do you dothat?
</p>
<p>
 There you go!The Swiss can not only build watches.
</p>
<p>
What does the boss want to punish me for, being in the room withyou?
</p>
<p>
 Do you think he'll take me to the first game against the Turks?I'm in top shape.
</p>
<p>
 Here we go again?
</p>
<p>
 Ja, er nimmt dich. : All right : Yes, he'll take you.
</p>
<p>
 Berni Klodt is also in goodshape.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe he'll take that one.
</p>
<p>
 Er nimmt den Berni. : Yes, you're right : Hetakes the Berni.
</p>
<p>
 Friedrich. That's fun now,isn't it?
</p>
<p>
 You know what? I'm going to take ashower.
</p>
<p>
 Funny guy.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Es gefällt dir nicht. : Let me guess : You don'tlike it.
</p>
<p>
 Well, soccer reporters...
</p>
<p>
 I always associate it with misery.
</p>
<p>
 The suite was booked forSchwerdtfeger.
</p>
<p>
 I am sure that otherwise I would havebeen accommodated under a bridge. - Oh well.
</p>
<p>
 So,the opening match will be between Yugoslavia and France? - Yes.
</p>
<p>
 And who do we stand by?
</p>
<p>
 As reporters, we have tobe neutral.
</p>
<p>
 And with Germany againstTurkey?
</p>
<p>
 Of course, we stand byGermany in this respect.
</p>
<p>
 Aren't we reporters there?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, it is.
</p>
<p>
 Isn't that a bit irrational?
</p>
<p>
 Can be, yes.
</p>
<p>
 Like me sometimes?
</p>
<p>
 Mary full of grace, theLord is with you.
</p>
<p>
 Blessed art thouamong women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,Mother of God, pray for us sinners...now and at the hour of ourdeath.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Gentlemen, here we go at last.
</p>
<p>
 We are playing against Turkey.
</p>
<p>
 The Turks have knocked outSpain.
</p>
<p>
 So we must notunderestimate them.
</p>
<p>
 Let's move on to the lineup :
</p>
<p>
 Toni, you play in goal.
</p>
<p>
 Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer, in der Läuferreihe :Eckel und Mai, in den Halbpositionen : Morlock und Fritz, imSturm auf links Hans Schäfer, in der Mitte Ottmar, rechtsaußen...Berni Klodt. Abfahrt ist in zwei Stunden. : In thedefensive line : Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer, in the halfback line :Eckel and Mai, in the half positions : Morlock and Fritz, in theforward on the left Hans Schäfer, in the center Ottmar, on the rightoutside...Berni Klodt. Departure is in two hours.
</p>
<p>
 I expect punctuality.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 1 gewonnen! : Goal! 4 : 1 won!
</p>
<p>
 Well played, Matthias.
</p>
<p>
 Well, Mr.Lubanski, that the government pays compensation to the war returnees
</p>
<p>
 compensation is correct.
</p>
<p>
 But your number of years is notcorrect.
</p>
<p>
 Nope. You don't make amistake with that :
</p>
<p>
 11 years and 4 months.
</p>
<p>
 You were sentenced in the Soviet Republic...for grandlarceny and sabotage...
</p>
<p>
 sentenced to 5 additionalyears.
</p>
<p>
 This is not a prisoner of war.
</p>
<p>
 You don't get any compensation forthat.
</p>
<p>
We stole a can of brown sugar because we were dying!
</p>
<p>
 Idon't doubt that, but that doesn't change the facts.
</p>
<p>
 Hundreds of thousands of us starved todeath.
</p>
<p>
 Hundreds I was allowed to watch!
</p>
<p>
 Sabotage, theft, itwas all a joke!
</p>
<p>
 I didn't make the rules.
</p>
<p>
 And you are not the firstto complain.
</p>
<p>
 At the same time, you canstill be glad that...
</p>
<p>
 Be happy? I can be happy?
</p>
<p>
 You know who can be happy? You!
</p>
<p>
 Because you haven't spent a dayin Russia!
</p>
<p>
And you can be glad that I don't beat your face in!
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians seem surprised by
</p>
<p>
 the lineup of the German team, but they will care little.
</p>
<p>
 50 penny.
</p>
<p>
 What, pay admission?
</p>
<p>
 You take it from the living.
</p>
<p>
 (TV commentary continues)
</p>
<p>
 Well? Everything clear?
</p>
<p>
 Nothing is clear at all.
</p>
<p>
 Herberger lets the substitutesplay.
</p>
<p>
 Careless ball...
</p>
<p>
 What are you doing?
</p>
<p>
 Goal!
</p>
<p>
 I knew it. I knew it!
</p>
<p>
 What a shit!
</p>
<p>
 Why doesn't Kwiatkowski
</p>
<p>
 not hold on to the ball? - Matthias?
</p>
<p>
 Will you come here?
</p>
<p>
 A very bad start!
</p>
<p>
 Go ahead and sit down.
</p>
<p>
 Can you sell me a cigarette?
</p>
<p>
 Right.
</p>
<p>
 Here, I give you.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Yes!
</p>
<p>
 I saw you there in the church.
</p>
<p>
 You lit a candle.
</p>
<p>
 Will you also tell me for whom?
</p>
<p>
 Come on, say it.
</p>
<p>
 For Helmut Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 Helmut Rahn?
</p>
<p>
 Herberger usually does notput him up.
</p>
<p>
 That's when I thought I had to dosomething.
</p>
<p>
 Come outside.
</p>
<p>
 You light a candle in church, just so some ballkicker can...
</p>
<p>
 doesn't have to sit on thebench?
</p>
<p>
 Rahn is not just someball kicker!
</p>
<p>
 He is the best!
</p>
<p>
 Are you crazy? You areabusing the church!
</p>
<p>
 Off home!
</p>
<p>
 Think about the meaning of thechurch!
</p>
<p>
 But...
</p>
<p>
 Stop it now. And don't youstart crying!
</p>
<p>
 A German boy does not cry.
</p>
<p>
 What's going on?
</p>
<p>
 None of your business.
</p>
<p>
 One may well still ask.
</p>
<p>
 Shut up and get backinside. Go!
</p>
<p>
 (Sad Music)
</p>
<p>
 Did you hear that?
</p>
<p>
 &quot;A German boy does notcry.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 I wish he had never comeback.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, Alfred, hurry up! Comedown!
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 3. : 8 : 3.
</p>
<p>
 What an embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
 And only Herberger is to blame!
</p>
<p>
 I don't know what's wrong with you.
</p>
<p>
 I think it's very clever.
</p>
<p>
 Do you find.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, he is sparing his important people for the decisivematch against the Turks.
</p>
<p>
 That's what I would have done.
</p>
<p>
 Well, if that doesn't makeSeppl happy...
</p>
<p>
 Another cold drink?
</p>
<p>
 What's going on?
</p>
<p>
 Three pilsners. And three instock!
</p>
<p>
 Donot look. These are players from the German national team.
</p>
<p>
 So what?
</p>
<p>
 They drink one, just like us.
</p>
<p>
 Do you think Herberger will let them go on a booze cruiseduring the tournament?
</p>
<p>
 Oh! You mean they escaped?
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
Let's dance unobtrusively a little closer so we can hear what they'resaying.
</p>
<p>
 Eight pieces! And?
</p>
<p>
 How do you feel aboutbeing a stopgap?
</p>
<p>
 Wewere good enough for the dirty work, but watch this :
</p>
<p>
 Next time they will dowithout us.
</p>
<p>
 You still have it good.
</p>
<p>
 At least everyone scored a goal.
</p>
<p>
 I only got myself a fewbruises.
</p>
<p>
 Still can't perform properly.
</p>
<p>
 So what? Let's washdown the ƒrger.
</p>
<p>
But right. Must be worth it if the old man catches us. Cheers.

<p>
 Home we will not go...
</p>
<p>
 My God, he's heavy!
</p>
<p>
 These are the muscles.
</p>
<p>
 How?
</p>
<p>
 Just look at those thighs.
</p>
<p>
 Every single muscle istrained there.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, yes. It's okay.
</p>
<p>
 Who are you, buddy?
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann, Süddeutsche Zeitung.
</p>
<p>
 Great sports section.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 And you, madam?
</p>
<p>
 His wife.
</p>
<p>
 Too bad.
</p>
<p>
 We'll leave him here and get out ofhere.
</p>
<p>
 And we'll call the doorman,honey.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwise, they'll drag us intoit.
</p>
<p>
 What thighs.
</p>
<p>
 What a story.
</p>
<p>
 Dare or I'll divorce you.
</p>
<p>
 Then I dare.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Stop.
</p>
<p>
 Hello, Mr. Herberger.
</p>
<p>
 Greetings.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry, I was cleaning.
</p>
<p>
 Iwould be very grateful if you did not run over it.
</p>
<p>
 Cleaned at the time?
</p>
<p>
 When else?
</p>
<p>
May I sit here until the ground is dry?
</p>
<p>
 Sure.
</p>
<p>
 Did you lose today?
</p>
<p>
 And how!
</p>
<p>
 And you are no longer inthe competition?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, we did.We lost a battle, not the war.
</p>
<p>
 Tell me, young lady, do youhave children?
</p>
<p>
 Me?
</p>
<p>
 Nine pieces! And you?
</p>
<p>
 22. And one of themgives me great trouble.
</p>
<p>
 Surely your favorite child.
</p>
<p>
 They always make the most ƒrger.
</p>
<p>
That makes it especially difficult to punish him. - Oh, nonsense.
</p>
<p>
 How?
</p>
<p>
 Garbage. Rubbish. Bullshit.
</p>
<p>
 You are not in Germany now, there is no need to punishall the time.
</p>
<p>
 Whoever is not for me isagainst me.
</p>
<p>
 You also have to let 5 bestraight sometimes.
</p>
<p>
 No sweet without the sweet.
</p>
<p>
 When theapple is ripe, it falls from the tree by itself.
</p>
<p>
 Early bird catches the worm.
</p>
<p>
 The ball isround, and a game lasts 90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Tell me, are you stupid?
</p>
<p>
 It can be. Why?
</p>
<p>
 Theboss will send you home if he gets wind of it.
</p>
<p>
 And so what?
</p>
<p>
 One less substitute playerin Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
 We are one team, no matterwhat!
</p>
<p>
 And we need you likeeveryone else!
</p>
<p>
 It's too late now anyway.
</p>
<p>
 Dassler found me in frontof the hotel.
</p>
<p>
 Helmut, I want to know onething from you :
</p>
<p>
 Are you for us or are you againstus?
</p>
<p>
 How can I understand thequestion?
</p>
<p>
 If you're forus, I'll talk to Adi, but if something like this happens again, I'llkick your ass personally.
</p>
<p>
 I don't know you like that,Fritz.
</p>
<p>
 Are you serious?
</p>
<p>
 Of course I'm foryou, damn it! - Good.
</p>
<p>
 (Station Announcement)
</p>
<p>
 Come now!
</p>
<p>
 Do you knowwhere I've been looking for you?
</p>
<p>
 Switzerland, my ass.
</p>
<p>
 You'll be grounded for a week.
</p>
<p>
 Pants down. - How?
</p>
<p>
 die Hose runter! : I said : pants down!
</p>
<p>
 Bend over!
</p>
<p>
 Richard! Stop it now!
</p>
<p>
 Let me!
</p>
<p>
 Do you want to beat him bloody?
</p>
<p>
 Are you standing against me,too?
</p>
<p>
 Well? Are you standing up to metoo?
</p>
<p>
 It's not just about you!
</p>
<p>
 Doesn't it matter to you ifwe're doing well?
</p>
<p>
 Where did your&quot;education&quot; lead?
</p>
<p>
 The big guy isa communist loudmouth, the girl is a soldier's whore, and the littleweirdo wants to run away!
</p>
<p>
 Ask yourself why! Because ofyou!
</p>
<p>
 I just want to teach him discipline so that he is capableand becomes something.
</p>
<p>
 Oh, that's right.
</p>
<p>
 Where do you think I'vebeen for the last few years?
</p>
<p>
 I've brought thefamily through, built up the pub we live on, done the housework,brought up the children.
</p>
<p>
 Now you come and makeeverything bad
</p>
<p>
 and restore the&quot;order&quot;!
</p>
<p>
 I'm not saying thateverything is bad.
</p>
<p>
 Before you came,Richard, we were almost happy. Since you came, the children aredistraught and desperate!
</p>
<p>
 Should I go back to the camp?
</p>
<p>
 Stop feeling sorry foryourself!
</p>
<p>
 Can't you think about others just once
</p>
<p>
 think about others for 10 seconds?
</p>
<p>
 Since you've been around,everyone's been dealing non-stop with your moods, your moods, yourfeelings!
</p>
<p>
 Do you have a word ofappreciation for us?
</p>
<p>
 Bruno's music brings money, Ingrid serves, Mattesearns something with the cigarettes!
</p>
<p>
 So much fordiscipline. And, Richard :
</p>
<p>
 You have the leastdiscipline of all!
</p>
<p>
 Good afternoon, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
 Your questions, please. Mr.Holzmann?
</p>
<p>
 The lineup of Basel, the confusion inthe defense...did you want to grab the Hungarians with that?
</p>
<p>
 We have a tough game the day aftertomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 The Turks beat South Korea, so we have to play them again.
</p>
<p>
 We have to pass there.
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Ruhpoldt, please.
</p>
<p>
 Eight goalsagainst. Many Germans, and not just the experts, think that you havedone serious damage to German soccer.
</p>
<p>
 football by conceding eight goals.
</p>
<p>
The ball we're playing with here is Swiss-made.
</p>
<p>
The last time I saw it, it was still plump and round.
</p>
<p>
 So there is no trace of damage.
</p>
<p>
 (Laughter)
</p>
<p>
 The young colleague there, please.
</p>
<p>
 Mr.Herberger, the defeat against the Hungarians was a shock.
</p>
<p>
 Won't this tactic endanger the cohesion of our teamagainst the Turks?
</p>
<p>
 Isit even possible to coordinate attack and offense now?
</p>
<p>
 Wanted to say :
</p>
<p>
 Defense and defense.
</p>
<p>
 ƒh...
</p>
<p>
 What happens to the midfield?
</p>
<p>
 What will be?
</p>
<p>
 Der Ball ist rund und ein Spiel dauert 90Minuten. : You know, young man : the ball is round and a gamelasts 90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
 (Unintelligible conversations)
</p>
<p>
 So, men, the lineup :
</p>
<p>
Toni in goal, in defense Laband, and Posipal, in the run Bauer,Eckel and Mai, Morlock and Fritz behind Schäfer, Ottmar and BerniKlodt.
</p>
<p>
 Decisive match against Turkey.
</p>
<p>
 You know what it's all about, men.
</p>
<p>
 But beforethat, I'll read you letters that our compatriots sent me fromhome...on the occasion of the Hungary game :
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Mr. Herberger, if thenational coach doesn't know what to present...to a sports audience insuch cases, he should buy a rope...and hang it from the nearest tree,but in such a way that you can still use the rope.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Herberger, youbelong on trial for sabotage!
</p>
<p>
 It would be nice if you would drawthe consequences from the events that a decent person would draw
</p>
<p>
 would draw fromsomething like this, which is to resign.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Herberger must go.
</p>
<p>
Fifty on the bare soles of his feet, and away with him from Germany.
</p>
<p>
 The traitor nolonger belongs to us.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Now get out.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (Fritz) Chief, what's going on?
</p>
<p>
 We are among the last eight.
</p>
<p>
 Who should I put at rightwing?
</p>
<p>
 Berni or the boss?
</p>
<p>
 You are the game leader.
</p>
<p>
 What do you think?
</p>
<p>
 Klodt, Rahn, they're both good.
</p>
<p>
 Each has its own merits.
</p>
<p>
 Berni has played excellentlyso far.
</p>
<p>
 Harmonizes great with Morlock.
</p>
<p>
 If I let them play together, it's a sweetcombination game.
</p>
<p>
 But we can't storm off against Yugoslavia the way we didagainst the Turks.
</p>
<p>
 aus der Defensive heraus spielen. : That's when youhave to play from the defensive.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe the boss would be betterthere after all.
</p>
<p>
 Let him notplay or pass badly.
</p>
<p>
 I have afunny feeling he'll bring the decision.
</p>
<p>
 I think the bosswill not disappoint you.
</p>
<p>
 One more disappointment would be
</p>
<p>
 one too many, if youunderstand.
</p>
<p>
 So watch him a little bit.
</p>
<p>
 Hello, sport.
</p>
<p>
 Day.
</p>
<p>
 How is our prisoner doing?
</p>
<p>
 Sentenced to 5 years of housearrest...for desertion in combination with sabotage of piggy banks?
</p>
<p>
 Wenn er dich noch mal schlägt, schlag ich zurück.Versprochen, ok? : Watch out : If he hits you again, I'll hit himback. I promise, okay?
</p>
<p>
Captivity is an emergency situation, as we all know.
</p>
<p>
 One is allowed to use specialmeasures.
</p>
<p>
 If you can't listen to thequarter-final match...Germany vs. Yugoslavia at the cute Carola, itdoesn't mean you have to do without it completely.
</p>
<p>
 ...announce team lineup :
</p>
<p>
 Turek ingoal, Laband and Kohlmeyer in defense, in the halfback line Eckel,Liebrich and Mai play, in the forward line Helmut Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 Rahn plays. He plays!
</p>
<p>
 Food is ready.
</p>
<p>
 What, now?
</p>
<p>
 Better come down right away.
</p>
<p>
 I haven't eaten this wellin a long time!
</p>
<p>
 Yes, it was delicious, Dad.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, was edible.
</p>
<p>
 Can I have another piece?
</p>
<p>
 Sure.
</p>
<p>
 Here.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, it's your mother's birthday, butsince I've been away for so long, I'd like to give each of you agift.
</p>
<p>
 a gift to each of you.
</p>
<p>
 Here.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>
<p>
 Go ahead, take it.
</p>
<p>
 But that's nice.
</p>
<p>
 It's not fromEast Berlin, but it works.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Atze, Blacky, I have somethingto show you!
</p>
<p>
 Atze?
</p>
<p>
 Blacky.
</p>
<p>
 Shot from the dangerous Zebec.
</p>
<p>
 But Toni holds it safely.Bravo, Toni!
</p>
<p>
 Throwsthe ball now to Laband, who bravely replaces Posipal....
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Tiburski? What's the score?
</p>
<p>
 0. : Still 0 : 0.
</p>
<p>
 But the Yugos are all partisans.
</p>
<p>
 You can fight them onlywhere they show themselves.
</p>
<p>
 Have you seen my rabbits?
</p>
<p>
 Nah, kid, I didn't.
</p>
<p>
 Wait a minute, it's yourmom's birthday.
</p>
<p>
 Yes. Why?

<p>
 As if we have money for that.
</p>
<p>
 Stop shaking your head!
</p>
<p>
 I shake my head as muchas I want.
</p>
<p>
 You shut up and obey.
</p>
<p>
 Is that all they taughtyou?
</p>
<p>
 What do you mean by &quot;youguys&quot;?
</p>
<p>
 Since when am I &quot;youguys&quot; to you?
</p>
<p>
 No matter.
</p>
<p>
Do you think I'm a Nazi because I spent my best time lying in thedirt?
</p>
<p>
 As an individual, yousimply had to be there!
</p>
<p>
 Yes. You are nothing,your people are everything.
</p>
<p>
 How do you actually talk to me?
</p>
<p>
 Don't hit me again.
</p>
<p>
 Did I hold out for 11 years to have my own son makefun of me?
</p>
<p>
 I don't want the ball anymore.
</p>
<p>
 The black and white fromGrabitz has young.
</p>
<p>
 If you want, I'll get you two.
</p>
<p>
 I never want rabbits again.
</p>
<p>
 I understand that.
</p>
<p>
 Mom?
</p>
<p>
 Huh?
</p>
<p>
 Was dad like that before?
</p>
<p>
 How?
</p>
<p>
 So mean.
</p>
<p>
 Mattes?
</p>
<p>
Think about how it hurt you that Atze and Blacky are gone.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine that this is how you feel every day. For 12 years.
</p>
<p>
 Every day. Can you imaginethat?
</p>
<p>
 That's what it must have been like for Dad when he wasn'tallowed home. For 12 years.
</p>
<p>
 But I can't help it.
</p>
<p>
 Is it the dad's fault?
</p>
<p>
 You see? We can all do nothingabout it.
</p>
<p>
 But we can all helpit get better.
</p>
<p>
 Huh? You...
</p>
<p>
 You're a big one, my littleone.
</p>
<p>
 Your dad's a big guy, too.
</p>
<p>
 Actually.
</p>
<p>
 If we help him, you'll be amazed at what a great dad you have.
</p>
<p>
 We just needpatience, the rest will come by itself.
</p>
<p>
 0 gegen Jugoslawien, da war ja wirklich Glück im Spiel. :When we beat Yugoslavia 2-0, we were really lucky.
</p>
<p>
 Was the defensive tacticreally right?
</p>
<p>
 And wasit right to take out the good Klodt for Rahn?
</p>
<p>
Rahn scored a goal, all right, but how important is he really?
</p>
<p>
 You have it a littleeasier than I do.
</p>
<p>
Your game and that of your colleagues starts when ours is over.
</p>
<p>
But since we won, I think I did everything right.
</p>
<p>
Should Jupp Posipal really defend against Austria in the semifinals?
</p>
<p>
 This is how it is planned.
</p>
<p>
 You must not!
</p>
<p>
 Jupp is completely out of shape! Neither we nor thehome country have any understanding for this.
</p>
<p>
 Posipal defends against Austria.
</p>
<p>
 We want to become strong ondefense.
</p>
<p>
 Whether that is correct, wewill see.
</p>
<p>
 During thenail-biter...against Yugoslavia, didn't you once wish it wouldfinally be over?
</p>
<p>
 How did you feel after thegame?
</p>
<p>
 I don't know anything like that.
</p>
<p>
 After the game is before the game.
</p>
<p>
 Bruno, what are you doing?
</p>
<p>
 Nothing.
</p>
<p>
 Packing.
</p>
<p>
 Where do you want to go?
</p>
<p>
 I can't tell you that.
</p>
<p>
 But why do you want to leave?
</p>
<p>
 Oh, come on, you know that.
</p>
<p>
 With me and Dad, it justdoesn't work out.
</p>
<p>
 I'm sure it will get bettersoon.
</p>
<p>
 I want to get out of hereanyway, you know?
</p>
<p>
 I finally want to dosomething useful.
</p>
<p>
 All right. I'm going to Berlin.
</p>
<p>
 To East Berlin.
</p>
<p>
 To the East Zone?
</p>
<p>
 This isthe capital of the German Democratic Republic!
</p>
<p>
 There, all people areequal. There are no rich and no poor, no unemployed and freedom ofspeech!
</p>
<p>
 There's no such thing.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, they do, and from what I've heard, they coulduse a few more good musicians.
</p>
<p>
 I don't want you to go.
</p>
<p>
 Hey, kid!
</p>
<p>
 You are the best man in thefamily.
</p>
<p>
 I know that.
</p>
<p>
 And I'm counting on you.
</p>
<p>
 I can do that, can't I?
</p>
<p>
 This one is for dad and mom.
</p>
<p>
 Don't worry, there's nothing bad in it, just the truth. Butwait!
</p>
<p>
 I need a week's head start,okay?
</p>
<p>
 You have to promise me that.
</p>
<p>
 Come here.
</p>
<p>
 Huh?
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Lubanski.
</p>
<p>
 Good day, Reverend.
</p>
<p>
 Excuse me, do you have a moment?
</p>
<p>
 But of course. Come.
</p>
<p>
 Who would have thought that?
</p>
<p>
We are in the semifinals! And a boy from here scored a goal.
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 Is incredible.
</p>
<p>
 In the semifinals, it'sagainst Austria.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, that will be atleast as difficult.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, I'm nothere to talk about soccer.
</p>
<p>
 Of course not. Sorry.
</p>
<p>
 I just don't know what to doanymore.
</p>
<p>
 Nothing is the way it used to be.
</p>
<p>
 I try to do everythingright.
</p>
<p>
 But that only makes things worse.
</p>
<p>
 Now Bruno is gone, too.
</p>
<p>
 I know very many prisonersof war.
</p>
<p>
 Mostreturnees are ashamed of their time in misery.
</p>
<p>
 Theyexclude their families, pretend to be strong.
</p>
<p>
 In reality, they are afraid to show what captivityhas done to them.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Didn't you get anything to eat?
</p>
<p>
 Nope.
</p>
<p>
 We have not.
</p>
<p>
 It's like this.
</p>
<p>
 Where we never had enoughto eat was....
</p>
<p>
 The Russians had nothing themselves.
</p>
<p>
 We had everything...
</p>
<p>
 devastated and burned.
</p>
<p>
 I wasable to grasp with my fingers around my thigh.
</p>
<p>
 (Football commentary on the radio)
</p>
<p>
 The mostimportant thing was to be able to get up in the morning.
</p>
<p>
 Then the first thing you did was touch your comradenext to you to see if he was still warm.
</p>
<p>
 Whether he is still alive.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe his bootscould still be used.
</p>
<p>
At some point, those unable to work were sent home by the Russians.
</p>
<p>
Many of us wanted to make ourselves sick because we wanted to gohome.
</p>
<p>
 They dranksalt water...and died from it.
</p>
<p>
 Those who did not yet havedystrophy, who could still walk, they put them in work brigades.
</p>
<p>
They sent me to Siberia as a specialist in open pit mining.
</p>
<p>
 Haven't you ever thought abouthome?
</p>
<p>
 I...
</p>
<p>
 I didn't believe in homeanymore.
</p>
<p>
 I haven't thought about youanymore.
</p>
<p>
 I onlycounted the winters...and thought about food.
</p>
<p>
 Every now and then,the farmers would slip us something.
</p>
<p>
And on the way back, a Russian took me to his home.
</p>
<p>
 He showed me a picture.
</p>
<p>
 With a...black ribbon around it.
</p>
<p>
 It was a picture of his son.
</p>
<p>
I know I have not always behaved properly toward you.
</p>
<p>
 But...
</p>
<p>
 I just don't know my way aroundanymore.
</p>
<p>
 It's all so foreign here.
</p>
<p>
 And with Bruno, that hadbeen my fault.
</p>
<p>
 Bruno couldn't stand it hereanymore.
</p>
<p>
 He had to replace you for so long.
</p>
<p>
 I think now he justwanted to leave.
</p>
<p>
 He is oldenough to make his own decisions.
</p>
<p>
 But here are three others.
</p>
<p>
 They need you.
</p>
<p>
 A gift corner kick forGermany!
</p>
<p>
 Wouldn'tsurprise me if the 4th goal would fall now.
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter shoots withhis right foot.
</p>
<p>
 Deflected. Goal. Goal!
</p>
<p>
 Goal for Germany.
</p>
<p>
 Goal for Germany!
</p>
<p>
 Ottmar Walter, Ottmar Walter!
</p>
<p>
 1 für Deutschland. : 4 : 1 for Germany.
</p>
<p>
 I am speechless!
</p>
<p>
 (Austrian reporter) So you can see, if youlook at the expressions now, as far as you can see them from thisdistance, that our players are already resigning.
</p>
<p>
 It almost seems... Let's leaveit!
</p>
<p>
Happel has now presented a ball...once again to the Germans.
</p>
<p>
 What's going on today?
</p>
<p>
 Wagner to Probst, Probst forward to Körner 2, who tries a trick.
</p>
<p>
It fails. Grain 2 to Stojaspal, who hooks away to grain 2...
</p>
<p>
 the one hook once again toProbst.
</p>
<p>
 Probst shoots and hits the grass!
</p>
<p>
 Quite apart from that, Körner 2 and Stojaspal shouldhave shot long ago!
</p>
<p>
 Speedis not witchcraft, as the Germans show us today!
</p>
<p>
 But we are too slow.
</p>
<p>
 Stojaspal on the ball,wants to put Probst in, but he is in Liebrich's hands as if he were ababy...
</p>
<p>
 and the Liebrich his mother.
</p>
<p>
 So, who do we get in the final?
</p>
<p>
 That interests you?
</p>
<p>
What was that the other day about the 24 people chasing a ball?
</p>
<p>
Oh, the other day! The other day I was still an ignorant child. So?
</p>
<p>
 Hungary.
</p>
<p>
 2 geschlagen. - SchöneBescherung. : They beat Uruguay 4 : 2 in overtime. - Nice gift.
</p>
<p>
 Those wild goal scorersagain.
</p>
<p>
 We canhope to lose by only single digits this time.
</p>
<p>
 We're not losing again!
</p>
<p>
 That would not be fair.
</p>
<p>
 Good idea. We just...apply to Fifa for a fair outcome!
</p>
<p>
 All right, wise guy.
</p>
<p>
 Wir gewinnen! : I'll tell you somethingnow : We're winning!
</p>
<p>
 And make shashlik from theHungarians.
</p>
<p>
 You mean goulash, honey.
</p>
<p>
 When I say shish kebab,that's what I mean.
</p>
<p>
 Good. What do we bet?
</p>
<p>
 If we everhave kids, I get to pick the names.
</p>
<p>
 If Germany wins.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwise, I'll pick the names.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;And that's why, for me, you are the legitimate successor toFritz Walter.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck, yours, CarmenBallmann.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Well?
</p>
<p>
Carmen Ballmann. Admit it, Horst, you wrote those yourself.
</p>
<p>
 This is a giant soccer expert, there's no doubt aboutit!
</p>
<p>
 Look at our little ones. I bet we disturbed them atnight prayer.
</p>
<p>
 Wasn'tthat guy there today with the guide dog in the square?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, exactly!
</p>
<p>
 Wir sind im Endspiel! : You're not so good at thinking,so I'll say it again slowly : We're in the final!
</p>
<p>
 Afterwards, you'll be draped in gold and carried offthe pitch in sedan chairs!
</p>
<p>
 Yes, and menlike me they carve into stone afterwards.
</p>
<p>
 Or in the frying pan, if you don't trip a ball intothe goal again soon.
</p>
<p>
 1. : Exactly. Where are your goals? 6: 1.
</p>
<p>
 Everyone had a go today, didn'tyou?
</p>
<p>
 You were just picking your nose!
</p>
<p>
 Come on, Fritz, let's go toToni's.
</p>
<p>
 He still appreciates realguys.
</p>
<p>
 And Ihave to pull his ears out because of the goal against.
</p>
<p>
 Sleep well, boys.
</p>
<p>
 In no case eight pieces again.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwisethey'll say Turkey was too weak, they were lucky against Yugoslavia,and Austria had a bad day!
</p>
<p>
 3 könnte man leben. : You could live with a 4 : 3.
</p>
<p>
 The ultimate on Sunday would be if it goes into overtime!
</p>
<p>
 But now I've had enough!
</p>
<p>
 Why should we lose at all?
</p>
<p>
 I would love to win,but....
</p>
<p>
 &quot;But...!&quot; I just haveto say it :
</p>
<p>
 Take an example from the boss.
</p>
<p>
 He's just talking about howhe's going to fill up
</p>
<p>
 the hut full. He's right!
</p>
<p>
 I would like to thank you again for this unscheduledconversation.
</p>
<p>
 We are, after all,unscheduled in the finals.
</p>
<p>
 Is theresuch a thing as a secret of this German team?
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter. : It hasa head, a thinker and a leader : Fritz Walter.
</p>
<p>
 Without him, real successwould be unthinkable.
</p>
<p>
 Ifhe had been injured early on, we wouldn't be sitting here now.
</p>
<p>
 Herberger! Herberger!
</p>
<p>
 Bravo! Bravo!
</p>
<p>
Strange! These are the same people you were talking to just two weeksago....
</p>
<p>
 openly hostile, because you gave the 1st game against uslost from the start.
</p>
<p>
 No,no, I had a strategy that would lead to victory.
</p>
<p>
 Only,unfortunately, it failed particularly miserably.
</p>
<p>
 I don'twant to sound presumptuous, Mr. Herberger, but....
</p>
<p>
Do you actually see a real chance of winning against Hungary?
</p>
<p>
 If the sunshines on Sunday, Hungary will be world champion.
</p>
<p>
 STOPPED HERE
</p>
<p>
 Then we can't stop you.
</p>
<p>
 We are clearly inferior in terms ofplay.
</p>
<p>
 But what if it rains?
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter weather.
</p>
<p>
 Then the ground becomes heavy.
</p>
<p>
 Then... we have a chance.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Matthias.
</p>
<p>
 Matthias, wake up. Come on, wake up!
</p>
<p>
 What is it?
</p>
<p>
 Get up. We're going for a ride.
</p>
<p>
 What kind of car is that?
</p>
<p>
 I borrowed it from the priest.
</p>
<p>
 (Matthias)
</p>
<p>
 Beautiful.
</p>
<p>
 Where are we going anyway?
</p>
<p>
 To Bern, for the final.
</p>
<p>
 What?
</p>
<p>
 You said yourself :
</p>
<p>
 Only whenyou're there does the boss win the important games.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Fucking shit!
</p>
<p>
 We lost the first game againstHungary
</p>
<p>
 3 verloren. Das hat sehr wehgetan. : with 8 : 3. That hurta lot.
</p>
<p>
 But as youall know, everything good and beautiful carries...
</p>
<p>
 already contain the seeds ofdestruction.
</p>
<p>
 And also vice versa.
</p>
<p>
 8 goals conceded.
</p>
<p>
 What do we learn from this?
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians are an exceptionalteam.
</p>
<p>
Undefeated for 4 years! Except Lorant, Kocsis, Bozsik and Puskas...
</p>
<p>
 there are only players in the teamwho don't know what it's like to lose with the national team.
</p>
<p>
 But that doesn'tmean it can't be done.
</p>
<p>
 Because...
</p>
<p>
 we also scored three goals!
</p>
<p>
 Sie sind anfällig. : That is, they are vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
 And that is here.
</p>
<p>
 'over on the left. Bozsik plays so offensively thatholes always open up behind him.
</p>
<p>
 We have to use this free space!
</p>
<p>
 Hans...
</p>
<p>
 This is especially true for you.
</p>
<p>
 Puskas is back on his feet.He is playing.
</p>
<p>
 He may be injured, but he'll be eager to playagainst us.
</p>
<p>
 Werner Liebrich will takecare of him.
</p>
<p>
But if we want to win the final, then we have to hit the Hungarians
</p>
<p>
 in their hearts.
</p>
<p>
 And this is not Puskas.
</p>
<p>
 That's Hidegkuti.
</p>
<p>
He's nominally a center forward, but he pulls the strings inmidfield!
</p>
<p>
 The game runs through him.
</p>
<p>
 He is the one to be eliminated.
</p>
<p>
 Horst! Cling to his heels.
</p>
<p>
 Bite down on him.
</p>
<p>
 I want this man
</p>
<p>
 dream about you tonight!
</p>
<p>
 We have a big tacticaladvantage.
</p>
<p>
 We know the playing strengthof the Hungarians.
</p>
<p>
 Sie kennen unsere nicht. : Only : They don't know ours.
</p>
<p>
 They don't even know howstrong we are!
</p>
<p>
 Theydon't know that we are strong enough to beat them.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Adi! Stoll already times on.
</p>
<p>
 Nothing better than that, Seppl.
</p>
<p>
 (Unintelligible conversations)
</p>
<p>
Comrades, now the guys have to show whether they are really men!
</p>
<p>
 Welost the war, we are also losing this endgame.
</p>
<p>
 Father!
</p>
<p>
 (engine stutters)
</p>
<p>
 I don't know what's going oneither.
</p>
<p>
 I think it's onlyrunning on two pots now.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (Cheers)
</p>
<p>
 (German National Anthem)
</p>
<p>
(Zimmermann) Germany in the World Cup final, that's a huge sensation!
</p>
<p>
 This is a real soccer miracle, but it came about quitenaturally.
</p>
<p>
 We owe it to the soccerintelligence
</p>
<p>
 and the perfection of ourplayers.
</p>
<p>
 And the game here is aboutto begin.
</p>
<p>
 1... : Therefore, no long introduction, but just thelineup, which Austria with 6 : 1...
</p>
<p>
 in the final round match :
</p>
<p>
 Turekfrom Düsseldorf in goal, Posipal from Hamburg and Kohlmeyer
</p>
<p>
 from Kaiserslautern indefense.
</p>
<p>
 The runners' row with Eckeland Liebrich
</p>
<p>
 from Kaiserslautern and Maifrom Fürth.
</p>
<p>
 In the forward line, Rahn fromEssen at right wing, Morlock, Nuremberg, at half right, then the twoWalter brothers
</p>
<p>
 from Kaiserslautern andSchäfer from Cologne.
</p>
<p>
 Just now referee Link
</p>
<p>
 from England has justblown the whistle for the match, incidentally the same referee whoblew the whistle for the 1st match against Hungary.
</p>
<p>
 What a shit! And so early!
</p>
<p>
 We don't stand a chanceanymore.
</p>
<p>
 Why aren't they paying attentionback there?
</p>
<p>
 If this continues, itwill be without me!
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter) Whatwe feared has come to pass.
</p>
<p>
 The lightning start of the Hungarians
</p>
<p>
 gave them the lead.
</p>
<p>
 0 geht das aus! Und wir Deutschen : 12 : 0 is the score! Andwe Germans
</p>
<p>
 are the fools again! That's it!
</p>
<p>
 It was a very stupid mishap.
</p>
<p>
 A silly coincidence.
</p>
<p>
 0 für Ungarn. : And still it's 2 : 0for Hungary.
</p>
<p>
 If it's a boy, his name is Rüdiger, if it's a girl,Roswitha.
</p>
<p>
 Roswitha?
</p>
<p>
 Roswitha?
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 (Exciting music)
</p>
<p>
 Go, men! Let's go now!
</p>
<p>
 Come on. Nothing is lost yet.
</p>
<p>
 Youknow, in captivity, I learned a trick.
</p>
<p>
 With theperformance, you know, you can do anything.
</p>
<p>
 Wealways imagined eating our fill.
</p>
<p>
 And if the hunger
</p>
<p>
didn't get to us too much, then it worked out wonderfully.
</p>
<p>
 You just have to close your eyes, then you can go anywhere,even to Bern.
</p>
<p>
 It's as if you were thereyourself.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, try it.
</p>
<p>
 (Unintelligible)
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter) Goal! Goal for Germany!
</p>
<p>
 What did I say?
</p>
<p>
 Maybe we can still make it
</p>
<p>
 to the second half, huh?
</p>
<p>
 1. Rahns Schuss wurde abgefälscht : 2 : 1. Rahn's shot wasdeflected
</p>
<p>
 by a Hungarian defender!
</p>
<p>
 Maxl Morlock threw himselfinto the path of the shot.
</p>
<p>
 andwith his last strength he pushes the ball past the Hungarian
</p>
<p>
 past the goalkeeper of theHungarians, Grosics.
</p>
<p>
 0, es steht nur noch 2 : 1, unddas sollte unserer Elf : Thank God, it is no longer 2 : 0, it isonly 2 : 1, and that should give our eleven
</p>
<p>
 now give courage andself-confidence.
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter)
</p>
<p>
 Goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 (Mattes)
</p>
<p>
 Goal! Goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 (Zimmermann) Goal by Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 2. : The score is 2 : 2.
</p>
<p>
 The game is even again.
</p>
<p>
 You never play.Morlock stands two or three times all alone in front of the goal, andyou slam the thing into the clouds!
</p>
<p>
 You better take care of yourdefense!
</p>
<p>
 I guess the first two wereguest gifts!
</p>
<p>
 We can't iron everythingout in front!
</p>
<p>
 Tell that to Kohli. He doesn't even know how toplay back to the goalkeeper.
</p>
<p>
 You're stuck on the line!
</p>
<p>
 Are you blind, you secretplaymaker?
</p>
<p>
 I'm running my lungs out, and you're just playing to Fritz!- Silence!
</p>
<p>
 Save your breath.
</p>
<p>
 You will need it!
</p>
<p>
 Haven't you realized it yet?
</p>
<p>
 We can become world championshere!
</p>
<p>
 And you're just bickering here.
</p>
<p>
 2! : The score is 2 : 2!
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians arefurious. In the 2nd half
</p>
<p>
 they'll be all over you again!
</p>
<p>
 So pay attention. You have toburn again
</p>
<p>
 burn for 45 minutes!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 Ich soll in diesen Zug! : Ahrens said clearly : Ishould get on this train!
</p>
<p>
 But I can't keep up.
</p>
<p>
 Why not, Annette?
</p>
<p>
 I can't possibly do that toDante.
</p>
<p>
 Who is Dante?
</p>
<p>
 But you should really knowthat.
</p>
<p>
 This is your son.
</p>
<p>
 My son?
</p>
<p>
 Dante?
</p>
<p>
 I get to pick the names.

<p>
 Annette, you are wonderful.
</p>
<p>
 You know what?
</p>
<p>
 I don't care about this train!
</p>
<p>
 What's the point?
</p>
<p>
 Don't argue. Family comes first.
</p>
<p>
 Besides, you need to take it easynow.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry.

</p>
<p>
 I'm going crazy.

<p>
 Yes. Respect for your goal.

<p>
 I would like to have your nerves.

<p>
 Go on in, I'll be right back.
</p>
<p>
 I need to have a quicktoast with someone, okay?
</p>
<p>
 Boss? Here, just brought me
</p>
<p>
 a real buddy brought me.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, some real beer.
</p>
<p>
 I thought I'd share that withyou.
</p>
<p>
 Boss, you will never change.
</p>
<p>
 But if anyone can do it,you can.
</p>
<p>
 Who do we have here?
</p>
<p>
 Fits like a glove. Willste have?
</p>
<p>
 Toni, come here. Some girls
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 Where.
</p>
<p>
 And what do you think ofhim? Boss, I mean.
</p>
<p>
 He's a great act.
</p>
<p>
 No one can compete with him.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, you do. You can stand upto him.
</p>
<p>
 Wow.
</p>
<p>
 That's a great compliment.
</p>
<p>
From Bruno. He made me promise not to give it to you earlier.
</p>
<p>
 Dad, what's wrong?
</p>
<p>
 Bruno...
</p>
<p>
 He wishes us all the best and writes that we can visithim anytime.
</p>
<p>
 What must you think of yourfather?
</p>
<p>
 Sitting here crying like alittle child.
</p>
<p>
 You know, I think German boys

<p>
 Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest
</p>
<p>
 and bless what you have givenus.
</p>
<p>
 Amen. What about the teachingposition?
</p>
<p>
 I didn't go there.
</p>
<p>
 Excuse me? What is thatsupposed to mean?
</p>
<p>
 That I was not there.
</p>
<p>
 For weeks Ibeg Hartwig, and you don't even go?
</p>
<p>
 Idon't work for a man who supported the Nazis!
</p>
<p>
 On weekends, you help outin the business!
</p>
<p>
 That's where we practice&quot;negro music.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Forget it, you're working, period!
</p>
<p>
 Don't treat me like a child!
</p>
<p>
 Mattes, eat something!
</p>
<p>
 Not hungry.
</p>
<p>
 But afterwards there's nothing more.
</p>
<p>
 Rot-Weiss Essen lost, Mom.
</p>
<p>
 So what? They always lose.
</p>
<p>
 Bullshit!
</p>
<p>
 It's not so bad after all.
</p>
<p>
 Oh, mama!
</p>
<p>
 0 verloren... So 'n Mist! : Lost 1 : 0... What a bummer!
</p>
<p>
 And that against Aachen!
</p>
<p>
 What'sup, Atze? Come here, it tastes good. You can see that.
</p>
<p>
 Eats Blacky too.
</p>
<p>
 We'll never be German championsin our lifetime.
</p>
<p>
 Day together.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck!
</p>
<p>
 That looks good.
</p>
<p>
 I need a refill.
</p>
<p>
 Smells good!
</p>
<p>
 I still get money for thelast time.
</p>
<p>
 TomorrowI'll collect from the band, then you'll get it. - Band?
</p>
<p>
 'A band. &quot;Band&quot;sounds better.
</p>
<p>
 Don't forget your homework.
</p>
<p>
 I have already done that.
</p>
<p>
 So, have you digested your defeatyet?
</p>
<p>
 Right.
</p>
<p>
 Christa?
</p>
<p>
 Will you make me another one?
</p>
<p>
 Don't you have enough already?
</p>
<p>
 One more to go. Say a sentence
</p>
<p>
 with &quot;Hamama&quot;and &quot;Hattata&quot;.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Whenwe went for a bike ride once, it rained there.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 My mom wantedto know when you were going to pay your lid.
</p>
<p>
 Don't get fat here.
</p>
<p>
 You're worse than your age.
</p>
<p>
 My old man has been inRussia for 11 years.
</p>
<p>
 And as long asthat's the case, I'll do the fat one here.
</p>
<p>
 So, when?
</p>
<p>
 As soon as I have work.
</p>
<p>
 You can count on it.
</p>
<p>
 It's a word.
</p>
<p>
 So. I have to go to practice now.
</p>
<p>
 Handball?
</p>
<p>
 Very funny.
</p>
<p>
 (Rahn)
</p>
<p>
 Ouch! Fucking shit!
</p>
<p>
 Are you trying to kill me, fartknot?
</p>
<p>
 Sorry, but we are late!
</p>
<p>
 Late? For what?
</p>
<p>
 For training.
</p>
<p>
 What day is it today? -Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
 What time?
</p>
<p>
 Half past four.
</p>
<p>
 Ok. Fifteen minutes.
</p>
<p>
 Gee, boss, you look terrible.
</p>
<p>
 Yesterday was a bitlate.
</p>
<p>
 We had... we had a meeting.
</p>
<p>
 A meeting? About what?
</p>
<p>
 I forgot.
</p>
<p>
 We really need to hurry.
</p>
<p>
 You're a real pest, Mattes.
</p>
<p>
 First I am almost stoned
</p>
<p>
 and then still rushed.
</p>
<p>
 Can't you ring the bell normally?
</p>
<p>
 Your predecessor, Micha, wason his toes!
</p>
<p>
 After every big game hestood there
</p>
<p>
 with two bottles of ice-coldbeer.
</p>
<p>
 Hey, pellet. Are you offendednow?
</p>
<p>
 Nah, but...
</p>
<p>
 You might get another carrier if I don't do it wellenough.
</p>
<p>
 Don't talk nonsense, Mattes!
</p>
<p>
 You're my mascot!
</p>
<p>
 I only win if you're there!
</p>
<p>
 We saw that again in Aachen.
</p>
<p>
 You probably don't think so.But it's true, really.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you're around, I can always turn the close games around.
</p>
<p>
 Every time! Okay? Come on, then.
</p>
<p>
 Hurry up! Otherwise I'll have topay 50 pfennigs
</p>
<p>
 into the team treasury.
</p>
<p>
 Exactly.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Man, man, man!
</p>
<p>
 How the boss sneaksacross a square...
</p>
<p>
 Old man is not a D-train, Willi.
</p>
<p>
 (Willi) No wonder theylose in Aachen.
</p>
<p>
 Man, man, man!
</p>
<p>
 My grandma would have sunk ittoo.
</p>
<p>
 Helmut, you loser, you couldn'teven hit
</p>
<p>
 a furniture truck from 3 meters!
</p>
<p>
 I heard that, Willi!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Where have you been for so long?
</p>
<p>
 What's wrong?
</p>
<p>
 Shedidn't want to open it until all the men were there.
</p>
<p>
 And if he is dead?
</p>
<p>
 Soon we will be
</p>
<p>
 be a real family again.
</p>
<p>
 What?
</p>
<p>
 Are you not happy at all?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, it is.
</p>
<p>
 Now Wewetzer comes through the middle, plays to Paetz, whopasses to Kruhl!
</p>
<p>
 He shoots... and goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 Goal by Kruhl in the 81st minute!
</p>
<p>
 This is the decision
</p>
<p>
 here in Hamburg's VolksparkStadium!
</p>
<p>
 1. : What's the score? - 4 : 1.
</p>
<p>
 Not bad.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, but for Hanover. Word ofhonor!
</p>
<p>
 What? I don't believe it!
</p>
<p>
 1? : Hannover leads againstKaiserslautern 4 : 1?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, yes!
</p>
<p>
 And now here are gloatingcries loudly
</p>
<p>
 for Sepp Herberger.
</p>
<p>
 Because with FCK loses the team that is thebackbone of his national eleven!
</p>
<p>
 Oh dear, this is a difficulthour
</p>
<p>
 for the national coach!
</p>
<p>
It was also a difficult hour for Annette Ackermann, née vonHadding.
</p>
<p>
 Annette...
</p>
<p>
 Hello, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
 Well, are we off already?
</p>
<p>
 No, of course not. Sorry.
</p>
<p>
 What do you actually haveagainst soccer?
</p>
<p>
 I mean, I'm a sports journalist.
</p>
<p>
 You also have your good sides.
</p>
<p>
 Come with us to thestadium, to 1860!
</p>
<p>
 That's all I needed. Oh, here!
</p>
<p>
 I've been looking for this allthe time.
</p>
<p>
 What is it?
</p>
<p>
 Morocco.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to the house, my father
</p>
<p>
 also a honeymoon.
</p>
<p>
 Are you coming? If you have time
</p>
<p>
 between two soccer broadcasts.
</p>
<p>
You proposed, I accepted, and we got married.
</p>
<p>
 True.
</p>
<p>
 Besides, we might as well
</p>
<p>
 in ƒgypten to see the pyramids.
</p>
<p>
 Is this a vacation or a crusade?
</p>
<p>
 I knew you would be happy.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Will you take the bread, please?
</p>
<p>
 What if he's not there again?
</p>
<p>
 Don't drive me crazy!
</p>
<p>
 I'm nervous enough as it is.
</p>
<p>
 If only he's okay.
</p>
<p>
 Who knows what the Russiandid to him.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;TheRussian&quot; has given &quot;the German&quot;...
</p>
<p>
 kicked in theass, because &quot;the German&quot; had
</p>
<p>
 assaulted him for no reason.
</p>
<p>
 Here!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Karl-Heinz.
</p>
<p>
 Christa.
</p>
<p>
 I... I am Ingrid.
</p>
<p>
 And who is he?
</p>
<p>
 I had written to you about him.
</p>
<p>
 I never got a letter.
</p>
<p>
 I'm sorry to hear that.
</p>
<p>
 Matthias came afteryou had to go back to the front.
</p>
<p>
 9 months after you had to goback.
</p>
<p>
 You talk when you're asked.
</p>
<p>
 And it's named after my father?
</p>
<p>
 There. That's it!
</p>
<p>
 We have closed today, of course
</p>
<p>
 because of you.
</p>
<p>
 And the colliery is only fiveminutes
</p>
<p>
 by bike.
</p>
<p>
 You're standing behind the counterhere?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, and Ingrid helps as awaitress.
</p>
<p>
 And Bruno?
</p>
<p>
 Not me. I am a musician.
</p>
<p>
 Musicians! So...
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 And who is that?
</p>
<p>
 This is the boss.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, his name is Helmut Rahnand...
</p>
<p>
 And plays for Rot-Weiss Essen.
</p>
<p>
 He iseven a national player, and he is my best friend.
</p>
<p>
 Soon it will be the World Cup and...
</p>
<p>
 Your best friend.
</p>
<p>
 I carry his bag
</p>
<p>
 and in return I get free admission.
</p>
<p>
 He's kind of a father figure tohim.
</p>
<p>
 The children are completely... It's about timethat they learn proper discipline again.
</p>
<p>
 I had so little time for them because of the economy and all....
</p>
<p>
 That will bedifferent once I have my compensation.
</p>
<p>
 I'll be starting again soon onshaft 4.
</p>
<p>
 I can feed my family myself.
</p>
<p>
 We can then sell the pub.
</p>
<p>
 Give me a little more time,Christa.
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann! Congratulations belatedly.
</p>
<p>
 Good morning, Mr. Ahrens. Thankyou.
</p>
<p>
 Your wife already in othercircumstances?
</p>
<p>
 Not yet. But we practicediligently.
</p>
<p>
 Frauen sind der : Beautiful. But be careful :Women are the
</p>
<p>
 natural enemy of soccer.
</p>
<p>
 As the years go by, thenagging becomes less.
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann, I have a problem here.
</p>
<p>
 Yes?
</p>
<p>
 I need a good man
</p>
<p>
 for Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
 For the World Cup?
</p>
<p>
 Exactly.
</p>
<p>
 I thought Schwerdtfeger wasdoing that.
</p>
<p>
 He's out of Herberger'sleague.
</p>
<p>
 After the commentary on theSaarland match.
</p>
<p>
 So Ineed a man down there who has a clean slate
</p>
<p>
 and talent to boot.
</p>
<p>
 You mean... me?
</p>
<p>
 And a quick perception.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 nichts! : Everywhere you look : nothing!
</p>
<p>
 Honey! Finally. Help me choose.
</p>
<p>
 I have to tell you something,Annette.
</p>
<p>
 The honeymoon falls through.
</p>
<p>
 Ahrens ordered me to the World Cup.
</p>
<p>
 That is not true.
</p>
<p>
 This is a uniqueopportunity.
</p>
<p>
 I can't leave those out.
</p>
<p>
 This bolting is seriouslymore important to you
</p>
<p>
 than your honeymoon with yourwife?
</p>
<p>
 24 guys running behind
</p>
<p>
 a single ball?
</p>
<p>
 22.
</p>
<p>
 22 for all I care.
</p>
<p>
 It would be boringif everyone had a ball.
</p>
<p>
 All right, Ackermann.
</p>
<p>
 What does &quot;All right&quot; mean?
</p>
<p>
 You can drive.
</p>
<p>
 Ah yes?
</p>
<p>
 On one condition.
</p>
<p>
 And what would that be?
</p>
<p>
 I will come with you.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, pellet, I'll be backsoon.
</p>
<p>
 Can't I come with you after all?
</p>
<p>
 You can't sleep under my bed.
</p>
<p>
 I'm in the same room withFritz Walter.
</p>
<p>
 When you snore, he sleepsbadly.
</p>
<p>
 And then he plays badly.
</p>
<p>
 And then we lose and areeliminated.
</p>
<p>
 Do you want that? - Nope.
</p>
<p>
 You said that you can'twin the big games
</p>
<p>
 you can't win the big games withoutme.
</p>
<p>
 True. Nevertheless, that's not possible.
</p>
<p>
 What would your father say?
</p>
<p>
 I would rather have you as myfather.
</p>
<p>
 Don't say that, Mattes.
</p>
<p>
Your father's going through a hard time, and he needs you here now.
</p>
<p>
 I'm sure things will get bettersoon.
</p>
<p>
 Good.Then read again, but slowly and to enjoy, yes?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 With sporting regards,i. A. Passler&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Hopefully they haveenough mosquitoes with them.
</p>
<p>
 Time to leave. Come.
</p>
<p>
 (locomotive whistle)
</p>
<p>
 Good luck, boss.
</p>
<p>
 You too, fart knot.
</p>
<p>
 (conductor)
</p>
<p>
 Caution, please!
</p>
<p>
 We welcome here in the studio
</p>
<p>
 our national goalkeeper AntonTurek.
</p>
<p>
 He is called only Toni and has
</p>
<p>
 in favor of the latehomecomers....
</p>
<p>
 from Russian captivity
</p>
<p>
 from Russian captivity. Toni.
</p>
<p>
 Yes. I have here
</p>
<p>
 an original World Cup ball.
</p>
<p>
 All comrades of FortunaDüsseldorf
</p>
<p>
 have signed on it.
</p>
<p>
 We hope that a nice sum
</p>
<p>
 for the returnees will comeout of it...
</p>
<p>
 and wish all participants
</p>
<p>
 from here very much the fingers.
</p>
<p>
 And I would be very pleased if one or the othercomrade...
</p>
<p>
 with your help it would be alittle easier
</p>
<p>
 in the home country again alittle easier.
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 It doesn't work with the reception!
</p>
<p>
 I'd better return theexpensive thing.
</p>
<p>
If you want to compete with Kessler, you have to keep this thing.
</p>
<p>
 Men are crazy about soccer.
</p>
<p>
 Just take your moronic son.
</p>
<p>
 He thinks Rahn won't winwithout him.
</p>
<p>
 Just not the important games!
</p>
<p>
 ...for the last training
</p>
<p>
 before the World Cup finals inSwitzerland.
</p>
<p>
 In the storm always in front and soalso
</p>
<p>
 immediately the first off the bus :
</p>
<p>
 Max Morlock from 1. FC Nürnberg, then Helmut Rahn from Rot-WeissEssen...
</p>
<p>
 and Berni Klodt from Schalke 04.
</p>
<p>
 Toni Turek from FortunaDüsseldorf...
</p>
<p>
 between Heinz Kubsch from FKPirmasens
</p>
<p>
 and Heinrich Kwiatkowski from BVB.
</p>
<p>
 Assistant coach Albert Sing
</p>
<p>
 sends Ottmar Walter from 1. FCK...
</p>
<p>
 and Herbert Erhard from the
</p>
<p>
 SpVgg Fürth through the course.
</p>
<p>
 These two will probably
</p>
<p>
 go to bed with a buzzinghead.
</p>
<p>
 Karlheinz Metzner from KSV HessenKassel
</p>
<p>
 and Uli Biesinger from BCAugsburg.
</p>
<p>
 At home they are localrivals, but here they strengthen together to really outplay theMagyars :
</p>
<p>
 Alfred Pfaff of EintrachtFrankfurt...
</p>
<p>
 and Richard Hermann from FSVFrankfurt.
</p>
<p>
 And that will give ourpreliminary round opponents...
</p>
<p>
 Paul Mebus : certainly command respect :Paul Mebus
</p>
<p>
 from 1. FC Köln shows his foot skills, and teammateHans Schäfer
</p>
<p>
 wants to be in no way inferior tohim.
</p>
<p>
 During a cheerful card game
</p>
<p>
 recover from the strenuoustraining...
</p>
<p>
Werner Liebrich, Horst Eckel and Werner Kohlmeyer from Lauter.
</p>
<p>
 The Bavarians are a bit morecomfortable :
</p>
<p>
 Karl Mai from SpVgg Fürth...
</p>
<p>
 and Hans Bauer from BayernMunich.
</p>
<p>
 FritzLaband and Jupp Posipal, both of HSV, are currently completing
</p>
<p>
 probably the most pleasanttraining session :
</p>
<p>
 namely the one in autograph writing.
</p>
<p>
 But isn't there another one missing?
</p>
<p>
 Of course, the captain! And therehe is :
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter from 1. FCKaiserslautern.
</p>
<p>
 Bravo, Mr. Walter.
</p>
<p>
 Smile for me. There you go.
</p>
<p>
 And here once again theentire squad.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck, guys!
</p>
<p>
 The homeland keeps its fingerscrossed for you.
</p>
<p>
 Welcome home, Richard.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 It's good to have you back.
</p>
<p>
 A lot has changed down here.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck.
</p>
<p>
 (Screams)
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Men, in two weeks in Switzerland
</p>
<p>
 we want to make a goodimpression.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately, I see with some ofyou
</p>
<p>
 still glaring physicaldeficiencies.
</p>
<p>
 So we will do more gymnastics.
</p>
<p>
 We start with push-ups.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 You see, you have to work onyourselves.
</p>
<p>
 Use the course to trainhard.
</p>
<p>
Work on your weaknesses, but also train what you can.
</p>
<p>
 &quot; Ach, wie bald : As the saying goes : &quot;Oh,how soon
</p>
<p>
 fade beauty and form.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Beautifulyou are not, so at least fight for the rest.
</p>
<p>
 'brigens,Metzner, you are an outstanding soccer player.
</p>
<p>
 Butyou smoke secretly, and by doing so you betray your comrades.
</p>
<p>
 Because you would be evenbetter otherwise.
</p>
<p>
 That is why you are still goinghome today.
</p>
<p>
 Wasn't that a bit harsh?
</p>
<p>
 Of course. He's still allowed to stay, but they haveto know where they're going.
</p>
<p>
 Now let's see what you've got, Adi.
</p>
<p>
 Is lighter than its predecessor.
</p>
<p>
 True. But it is not.
</p>
<p>
 Don't make it so exciting.
</p>
<p>
 Screws...
</p>
<p>
 Exactly. Studs with screwthread.
</p>
<p>
 Screws!
</p>
<p>
 Brilliant!
</p>
<p>
 The right length for anyweather.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, yes, they fit perfectly.Of course they do.
</p>
<p>
 They are screwed on.
</p>
<p>
 So?
</p>
<p>
 I want two complete sets
</p>
<p>
 for the world championship!
</p>
<p>
 Listen carefully. I herebyforbid you
</p>
<p>
 from having any dealings with soldiers.
</p>
<p>
 But I just wanted to go witha friend....
</p>
<p>
 I forbid you to get alldolled up.
</p>
<p>
 That's not true. I just wantedto...
</p>
<p>
 As long as you live under my roof, there are certainrules for you.
</p>
<p>
 You'll abide by them, right?
</p>
<p>
 (Peter)
</p>
<p>
 Tip, top, tip, tip.
</p>
<p>
 Good, then I'll take the Lang.
</p>
<p>
 Then Akki and Nolden come tome.
</p>
<p>
 Then we take
</p>
<p>
 the Mischa and the Buri.
</p>
<p>
 I take then still
</p>
<p>
 the Rainer and the Carola.
</p>
<p>
 And you still get the Lubanski.
</p>
<p>
 Nah, we get Carola andher Mattes.
</p>
<p>
 All right.
</p>
<p>
 But next time you'll get this.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Hey! You're playing with us, man!
</p>
<p>
 Goal!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Set with &quot;x&quot;.
</p>
<p>
 It was probably nothing.
</p>
<p>
 Mom said you used to play
</p>
<p>
 you used to play soccer. - Nope.
</p>
<p>
 I am alsoonly allowed to play if they are odd.
</p>
<p>
 The girl was not bad at all.
</p>
<p>
 Carola. I can never get past her, not even with thebest tricks from the boss.
</p>
<p>
 Because you can't play likethat.
</p>
<p>
You imitate his tricks, his style, but it's not your style.
</p>
<p>
 And what is my style?
</p>
<p>
 You're tough and you can run.
</p>
<p>
 You run more than the others.
</p>
<p>
 You are a defender.
</p>
<p>
 The bad copy of a star
</p>
<p>
 no one will respect.
</p>
<p>
 (vocals)
</p>
<p>
 Werner Liebrich,Werner Liebrich, are you still sleeping?
</p>
<p>
 Are you still asleep?
</p>
<p>
 Do you not hear the bells?
</p>
<p>
 Do you not hear the bells?
</p>
<p>
 Ding, ding, dong.
</p>
<p>
 Ding, ding, dong.
</p>
<p>
 Is that a breeze. They should
</p>
<p>
 put it in cans and send it out.
</p>
<p>
 And if you run out of steam in the game, open up a snooze,Kohli.
</p>
<p>
 Lookat the boats there, you can sail around on the lake.
</p>
<p>
 These are pedalos, ottes,not boats.
</p>
<p>
 You'll only find them inKaiserslautern.
</p>
<p>
 Berni, the Urus train
</p>
<p>
 on the same place as we do!
</p>
<p>
 Really? Us and the defendingchampion!
</p>
<p>
 (Rahn) Guys, I'mstarting to get the tingles.
</p>
<p>
 Your wife has folded sobeautifully
</p>
<p>
 and you stuff it in the closetlike this!
</p>
<p>
 How do you distinguish oldfrom fresh?
</p>
<p>
 I smell it. How do you dothat?
</p>
<p>
 There you go! The Swiss
</p>
<p>
 can not only build watches.
</p>
<p>
What does the boss want to punish me for, being in the room withyou?
</p>
<p>
 Do you think he'll take me to the first game against the Turks?I'm in top shape.
</p>
<p>
 Here we go again?
</p>
<p>
 Ja, er nimmt dich. : All right : Yes, he'll take you.
</p>
<p>
 Berni Klodt is also in goodshape.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe he'll take that one.
</p>
<p>
 Er nimmt den Berni. : Yes, you're right : Hetakes the Berni.
</p>
<p>
 Friedrich. That's fun now,isn't it?
</p>
<p>
 You know what? I'm going to take ashower.
</p>
<p>
 Funny guy.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Es gefällt dir nicht. : Let me guess : You don'tlike it.
</p>
<p>
 Well, soccer reporters...
</p>
<p>
 I always associate it with misery.
</p>
<p>
 The suite was booked forSchwerdtfeger.
</p>
<p>
 I'm sure thatotherwise I would have been accommodated
</p>
<p>
 under a bridge. - Oh well.
</p>
<p>
 So, make the opening match
</p>
<p>
 Yugoslavia and France? - Yes.
</p>
<p>
 And who do we stand by?
</p>
<p>
 As reporters, we have tobe neutral.
</p>
<p>
 And with Germany againstTurkey?
</p>
<p>
 Of course, we stand byGermany in this respect.
</p>
<p>
 Aren't we reporters there?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, it is.
</p>
<p>
 Isn't that a bit irrational?
</p>
<p>
 Can be, yes.
</p>
<p>
 Like me sometimes?
</p>
<p>
 Mary full of grace, theLord is with you.
</p>
<p>
 Blessed art thou amongwomen, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
</p>
<p>
 blessed is the fruit of your womb,Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners....
</p>
<p>
 now and at the hour of our death.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Gentlemen, here we go at last.
</p>
<p>
 We are playing against Turkey.
</p>
<p>
 The Turks have knocked outSpain.
</p>
<p>
 So we must notunderestimate them.
</p>
<p>
 Let's move on to the lineup :
</p>
<p>
 Toni, you play in goal.
</p>
<p>
 Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer, in der Läuferreihe :: In the defensive line : Laband, Posipal, Kohlmeyer, in thehalfback line :
</p>
<p>
 Morlock und Fritz, im Sturm auflinks Hans Schäfer, in der Mitte Ottmar, rechts außen... : Eckeland Mai, in the half positions : Morlock and Fritz, in the forwardon the left Hans Schäfer, in the center Ottmar, outside right...
</p>
<p>
 Berni Klodt. Departure is intwo hours.
</p>
<p>
 I expect punctuality.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 1 gewonnen! : Goal! 4 : 1 won!
</p>
<p>
 Well played, Matthias.
</p>
<p>
 Well, Mr.Lubanski, that the government pays compensation to the war returnees
</p>
<p>
 compensation is correct.
</p>
<p>
 But your number of years is notcorrect.
</p>
<p>
 Nope. You don't make amistake with that :
</p>
<p>
 11 years and 4 months.
</p>
<p>
 They were born in the SovietRepublic of...
</p>
<p>
 for grand larceny and sabotage
</p>
<p>
 sentenced to 5 additionalyears.
</p>
<p>
 This is not a prisoner of war.
</p>
<p>
 You don't get any compensation forthat.
</p>
<p>
We stole a can of brown sugar because we were dying!
</p>
<p>
 Idon't doubt that, but that doesn't change the facts.
</p>
<p>
 Hundreds of thousands of us starved todeath.
</p>
<p>
 Hundreds I was allowed to watch!
</p>
<p>
 Sabotage, theft, itwas all a joke!
</p>
<p>
 I didn't make the rules.
</p>
<p>
 And you are not the firstto complain.
</p>
<p>
 At the same time, you canstill be glad that...
</p>
<p>
 Be happy? I can be happy?
</p>
<p>
 You know who can be happy? You!
</p>
<p>
 Because you haven't spent a dayin Russia!
</p>
<p>
And you can be glad that I don't beat your face in!
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians seem surprised by
</p>
<p>
 the lineup of the German team, but they will care little.
</p>
<p>
 50 penny.
</p>
<p>
 What, pay admission?
</p>
<p>
 You take it from the living.
</p>
<p>
 (TV commentary continues)
</p>
<p>
 Well? Everything clear?
</p>
<p>
 Nothing is clear at all.
</p>
<p>
 Herberger lets the substitutesplay.
</p>
<p>
 Careless ball...
</p>
<p>
 What are you doing?
</p>
<p>
 Goal!
</p>
<p>
 I knew it. I knew it!
</p>
<p>
 What a shit!
</p>
<p>
 Why doesn't Kwiatkowski
</p>
<p>
 not hold on to the ball? - Matthias?
</p>
<p>
 Will you come here?
</p>
<p>
 A very bad start!
</p>
<p>
 Go ahead and sit down.
</p>
<p>
 Can you sell me a cigarette?
</p>
<p>
 Right.
</p>
<p>
 Here, I give you.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Yes!
</p>
<p>
 I saw you there in the church.
</p>
<p>
 You lit a candle.
</p>
<p>
 Will you also tell me for whom?
</p>
<p>
 Come on, say it.
</p>
<p>
 For Helmut Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 Helmut Rahn?
</p>
<p>
 Herberger usually does notput him up.
</p>
<p>
 That's when I thought I had to dosomething.
</p>
<p>
 Come outside.
</p>
<p>
 You light a candle in church just so that some ballkicker can...
</p>
<p>
 doesn't have to sit on thebench?
</p>
<p>
 Rahn is not just someball kicker!
</p>
<p>
 He is the best!
</p>
<p>
 Are you crazy? You areabusing the church!
</p>
<p>
 Off home!
</p>
<p>
 Think about the meaning of thechurch!
</p>
<p>
 But...
</p>
<p>
 Stop it now. And don't youstart crying!
</p>
<p>
 A German boy does not cry.
</p>
<p>
 What's going on?
</p>
<p>
 None of your business.
</p>
<p>
 One may well still ask.
</p>
<p>
 Shut up and get backinside. Go!
</p>
<p>
 (Sad Music)
</p>
<p>
 Did you hear that?
</p>
<p>
 &quot;A German boy does notcry.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 I wish he had never comeback.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, Alfred, hurry up! Comedown!
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 3. : 8 : 3.
</p>
<p>
 What an embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
 And only Herberger is to blame!
</p>
<p>
 I don't know what's wrong with you.
</p>
<p>
 I think it's very clever.
</p>
<p>
 Do you find.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, he is saving hisimportant people for
</p>
<p>
 for the decisive matchagainst the Turks.
</p>
<p>
 That's what I would have done.
</p>
<p>
 Well, if that doesn't makeSeppl happy...
</p>
<p>
 Another cold drink?
</p>
<p>
 What's going on?
</p>
<p>
 Three pilsners. And three instock!
</p>
<p>
 Do not look. These are players
</p>
<p>
 of the German national team.
</p>
<p>
 So what?
</p>
<p>
 They drink one, just like us.
</p>
<p>
 Do you think Herberger is goingto let them
</p>
<p>
 go on a booze cruise during thetournament?
</p>
<p>
 Oh! You mean they escaped?
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
Let's dance unobtrusively a little closer so we can hear what they'resaying.
</p>
<p>
 Eight pieces! And?
</p>
<p>
 How do you feel aboutbeing a stopgap?
</p>
<p>
 Wewere good enough for the dirty work, but watch this :
</p>
<p>
 Next time they will dowithout us.
</p>
<p>
 You still have it good.
</p>
<p>
 At least everyone scored a goal.
</p>
<p>
 I only got myself a fewbruises.
</p>
<p>
 Still can't perform properly.
</p>
<p>
 So what? Let's washdown the ƒrger.
</p>
<p>
But right. Must be worth it if the old man catches us. Cheers.

<p>
 Home we will not go...
</p>
<p>
 My God, he's heavy!
</p>
<p>
 These are the muscles.
</p>
<p>
 How?
</p>
<p>
 Just look at those thighs.
</p>
<p>
 Every single muscle istrained there.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, yes. It's okay.
</p>
<p>
 Who are you, buddy?
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann, Süddeutsche Zeitung.
</p>
<p>
 Great sports section.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 And you, madam?
</p>
<p>
 His wife.
</p>
<p>
 Too bad.
</p>
<p>
 We'll leave him here and get out ofhere.
</p>
<p>
 And we'll call the doorman,honey.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwise, they'll drag us intoit.
</p>
<p>
 What thighs.
</p>
<p>
 What a story.
</p>
<p>
 Dare or I'll divorce you.
</p>
<p>
 Then I dare.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Stop.
</p>
<p>
 Hello, Mr. Herberger.
</p>
<p>
 Greetings.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry, I was cleaning.
</p>
<p>
 Iwould be very grateful if you did not run over it.
</p>
<p>
 Cleaned at the time?
</p>
<p>
 When else?
</p>
<p>
May I sit here until the ground is dry?
</p>
<p>
 Sure.
</p>
<p>
 Did you lose today?
</p>
<p>
 And how!
</p>
<p>
 And you are no longer inthe competition?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, we did.We lost a battle, not the war.
</p>
<p>
 Tell me, young lady, do youhave children?
</p>
<p>
 Me?
</p>
<p>
 Nine pieces! And you?
</p>
<p>
 22. and one of them
</p>
<p>
 gives me a lot of trouble.
</p>
<p>
 Surely your favorite child.
</p>
<p>
 They always make the most ƒrger.
</p>
<p>
That makes it especially difficult to punish him. - Oh, nonsense.
</p>
<p>
 How?
</p>
<p>
 Garbage. Rubbish. Bullshit.
</p>
<p>
 You are not in Germany now, there is no need to punishall the time.
</p>
<p>
 Whoever is not for me isagainst me.
</p>
<p>
 You also have to let 5 bestraight sometimes.
</p>
<p>
 No sweet without the sweet.
</p>

 When theapple is ripe, it falls from the tree by itself.

 The ball isround, and a game lasts 90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Tell me, are you stupid?
</p>
<p>
 It can be. Why?
</p>
<p>
 Theboss will send you home if he gets wind of it.
</p>
<p>
 And so what?
</p>
<p>
 One less substitute playerin Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
 We are one team, no matterwhat!
</p>
<p>
 And we need you likeeveryone else!
</p>
<p>
 It's too late now anyway.
</p>
<p>
 Dassler found me in frontof the hotel.
</p>
<p>
 Helmut, I want to know onething from you :
</p>
<p>
 Are you for us or are you againstus?
</p>
<p>
 How can I understand thequestion?
</p>
<p>
 If you're forus, I'll talk to Adi, but if something like this happens again, I'llkick your ass personally.
</p>
<p>
 I don't know you like that,Fritz.
</p>
<p>
 Are you serious?
</p>
<p>
 Of course I'm foryou, damn it! - Good.
</p>
<p>
 (Station Announcement)
</p>
<p>
 Come now!
</p>
<p>
 Do you knowwhere I've been looking for you?
</p>
<p>
 Switzerland, my ass.
</p>
<p>
 You'll be grounded for a week.
</p>
<p>
 Pants down. - How?
</p>
<p>
 die Hose runter! : I said : pants down!
</p>
<p>
 Bend over!
</p>
<p>
 Richard! Stop it now!
</p>
<p>
 Let me!
</p>
<p>
 Do you want to beat him bloody?
</p>
<p>
 Are you standing against me,too?
</p>
<p>
 Well? Are you standing up to metoo?
</p>
<p>
 It's not just about you!
</p>
<p>
 Doesn't it matter to you ifwe're doing well?
</p>
<p>
 Where did your&quot;education&quot; lead?
</p>
<p>
 The big guy isa communist loudmouth, the girl is a soldier's whore, and the littleweirdo wants to run away!
</p>
<p>
 Ask yourself why! Because ofyou!
</p>
<p>
 I just want to teach him discipline so that he is capableand becomes something.
</p>
<p>
 Oh, that's right.
</p>
<p>
 Where do you think I'vebeen for the last few years?
</p>
<p>
 I've brought thefamily through, built up the pub we live on, done the housework,brought up the children.
</p>
<p>
 Now you come and makeeverything bad
</p>
<p>
 and restore the&quot;order&quot;!
</p>
<p>
 I'm not saying thateverything is bad.
</p>
<p>
 Before you came,Richard, we were almost happy. Since you came, the children aredistraught and desperate!
</p>
<p>
 Should I go back to the camp?
</p>
<p>
 Stop feeling sorry foryourself!
</p>
<p>
 Can't you think about others just once
</p>
<p>
 think about others for 10 seconds?
</p>
<p>
 Since you arrived, everyonehas been
</p>
<p>
 with yourmoods, your emotions, your feelings!
</p>
<p>
 Do you have a word ofappreciation for us?
</p>
<p>
 Bruno's music brings money, Ingrid serves, Mattesearns something with the cigarettes!
</p>
<p>
 So much fordiscipline. And, Richard :
</p>
<p>
 You have the leastdiscipline of all!
</p>
<p>
 Good afternoon, gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
 Your questions, please. Mr.Holzmann?
</p>
<p>
 Basel'slineup, the disarray in the defense....
</p>
<p>
 did you want to use it to grab theHungarians?
</p>
<p>
 We have a tough game the day aftertomorrow.
</p>
<p>
 The Turks beat South Korea, so we have to play them again.
</p>
<p>
 We have to pass there.
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Ruhpoldt, please.
</p>
<p>
 Eight goalsagainst. Many Germans, and not just the experts, think that you havedone serious damage to German soccer.
</p>
<p>
 football by conceding eight goals.
</p>
<p>
The ball we're playing with here is Swiss-made.
</p>
<p>
The last time I saw it, it was still plump and round.
</p>
<p>
 So there is no trace of damage.
</p>
<p>
 (Laughter)
</p>
<p>
 The young colleague there, please.
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Herberger, the defeat
</p>
<p>
 against the Hungarians was a shock.
</p>
<p>
 Doesn't this tactic endanger thecohesion
</p>
<p>
 of our team against theTurks?
</p>
<p>
 Is it possible to coordinate attack andoffense
</p>
<p>
 be coordinated at all now?
</p>
<p>
 Wanted to say :
</p>
<p>
 Defense and defense.
</p>
<p>
 ƒh...
</p>
<p>
 What happens to the midfield?
</p>
<p>
 What will be?
</p>
<p>
 Der Ball ist rund : You know, young man :The ball is round
</p>
<p>
 and a game lasts 90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
 (Unintelligible conversations)
</p>
<p>
 So, men, the lineup :
</p>
<p>
Toni in goal, in defense Laband, and Posipal, in the run Bauer,Eckel and Mai, Morlock and Fritz behind Schäfer, Ottmar and BerniKlodt.
</p>
<p>
 Decisive match against Turkey.
</p>
<p>
 You know what it's all about, men.
</p>
<p>
 But before that, I'll read you letters that ourcompatriots from home...
</p>
<p>
 on the occasion of the Hungarymatch :
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Mr. Herberger, if the national coach does notknow what to do in such...
</p>
<p>
 has to present to a sports audience, he should buy a rope...
</p>
<p>
 And hang on the nearest tree, but in such away that you can still recycle the rope.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Herberger, youbelong on trial for sabotage!
</p>
<p>
 It would be nice if youcould draw the consequences
</p>
<p>
 theconsequences that a decent human being would draw
</p>
<p>
 would draw fromsomething like this, which is to resign.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Herberger must go.
</p>
<p>
Fifty on the bare soles of his feet, and away with him from Germany.
</p>
<p>
 The traitor nolonger belongs to us.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Now get out.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (Fritz) Chief, what's going on?
</p>
<p>
 We are among the last eight.
</p>
<p>
 Who should I put at rightwing?
</p>
<p>
 Berni or the boss?
</p>
<p>
 You are the game leader.
</p>
<p>
 What do you think?
</p>
<p>
 Klodt, Rahn, they're both good.
</p>
<p>
 Each has its own merits.
</p>
<p>
 Berni has played excellentlyso far.
</p>
<p>
 Harmonizes great with Morlock.
</p>
<p>
 If I let them play together, it's a sweetcombination game.
</p>
<p>
 But against Yugoslavia wecannot
</p>
<p>
 as we did against the Turks.
</p>
<p>
 There it is called :
</p>
<p>
 play from the defensive.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe the boss would be betterthere after all.
</p>
<p>
 Let him not play
</p>
<p>
 or play badly.
</p>
<p>
 I have afunny feeling he'll bring the decision.
</p>
<p>
 I think the bosswill not disappoint you.
</p>
<p>
 One more disappointment would be
</p>
<p>
 one too many, if youunderstand.
</p>
<p>
 So watch him a little bit.
</p>
<p>
 Hello, sport.
</p>
<p>
 Day.
</p>
<p>
 How is our prisoner doing?
</p>
<p>
 Sentenced to 5 years ofconfinement...
</p>
<p>
 for desertion in unity of crime
</p>
<p>
 with sabotage of piggy banks?
</p>
<p>
 Wenn er dich noch mal schlägt, schlag ich zurück.Versprochen, ok? : Watch out : If he hits you again, I'll hit himback. I promise, okay?
</p>
<p>
Captivity is an emergency situation, as we all know.
</p>
<p>
 You are allowed to usespecial measures.
</p>
<p>
 When you watch the quarterfinalmatch...
</p>
<p>
 Germany against Yugoslavia
</p>
<p>
 can listen to at the cuteCarola, it does not mean that you have to do without it completely.
</p>
<p>
 ...announce team lineup :
</p>
<p>
 Turek ingoal, Laband and Kohlmeyer in defense, in the halfback line Eckel,Liebrich and Mai play, in the forward line Helmut Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 Rahn plays. He plays!
</p>
<p>
 Food is ready.
</p>
<p>
 What, now?
</p>
<p>
 Better come down right away.
</p>
<p>
 I haven't eaten this wellin a long time!
</p>
<p>
 Yes, it was delicious, Dad.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, was edible.
</p>
<p>
 Can I have another piece?
</p>
<p>
 Sure.
</p>
<p>
 Here.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, it's your mother's birthday, butsince I've been away for so long, I'd like to give each of you agift.
</p>
<p>
 a gift to each of you.
</p>
<p>
 Here.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you!
</p>
<p>
 Go ahead, take it.
</p>
<p>
 But that's nice.
</p>
<p>
 It's not fromEast Berlin, but it works.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Atze, Blacky, I have somethingto show you!
</p>
<p>
 Atze?
</p>
<p>
 Blacky.
</p>
<p>
 Shot from the dangerous Zebec.
</p>
<p>
 But Toni holds it safely.Bravo, Toni!
</p>
<p>
 Throwsthe ball now to Laband, who bravely replaces Posipal....
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Tiburski? What's the score?
</p>
<p>
 0. : Still 0 : 0.
</p>
<p>
 But the Yugos are all partisans.
</p>
<p>
 You can fight them onlywhere they show themselves.
</p>
<p>
 Have you seen my rabbits?
</p>
<p>
 Nah, kid, I didn't.
</p>
<p>
 Wait a minute, it's yourmom's birthday.
</p>
<p>
 Yes. Why?
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (Dramatic Music)
</p>
<p>
 ('surrenders)
</p>
<p>
 (Bruno)
</p>
<p>
 I thought they were off the market.
</p>
<p>
 As if we have money for that.
</p>
<p>
 Stop shaking your head!
</p>
<p>
 I shake my head as muchas I want.
</p>
<p>
 You shut up and obey.
</p>
<p>
 Is that all they taughtyou?
</p>
<p>
 What do you mean by &quot;youguys&quot;?
</p>
<p>
 Since when am I &quot;youguys&quot; to you?
</p>
<p>
 No matter.
</p>
<p>
Do you think I'm a Nazi because I spent my best time lying in thedirt?
</p>
<p>
 As an individual, yousimply had to be there!
</p>
<p>
 Yes. You are nothing,your people are everything.
</p>
<p>
 How do you actually talk to me?
</p>
<p>
 Don't hit me again.
</p>
<p>
 Did I hold out for 11 years to have my own son makefun of me?
</p>
<p>
 I don't want the ball anymore.
</p>
<p>
 The black and white fromGrabitz has young.
</p>
<p>
 If you want, I'll get you two.
</p>
<p>
 I never want rabbits again.
</p>
<p>
 I understand that.
</p>
<p>
 Mom?
</p>
<p>
 Huh?
</p>
<p>
 Was dad like that before?
</p>
<p>
 How?
</p>
<p>
 So mean.
</p>
<p>
 Mattes?
</p>
<p>
Think about how it hurt you that Atze and Blacky are gone.
</p>
<p>
 Now imagine that you feel likethis
</p>
<p>
 every day like this. For 12 years.
</p>
<p>
 Every day.
</p>
<p>
 Can you imagine that?
</p>
<p>
 That's what it must have been like for Dad when he wasn'tallowed home. For 12 years.
</p>
<p>
 But I can't help it.
</p>
<p>
 Is it the dad's fault?
</p>
<p>
 You see? We can all do nothingabout it.
</p>
<p>
 But we can all helpit get better.
</p>
<p>
 Huh? You...
</p>
<p>
 You're a big one, my littleone.
</p>
<p>
 Your dad's a big guy, too.
</p>
<p>
 Actually.
</p>
<p>
 If we help him, you'll be amazed at what a great dad you have.
</p>
<p>
 We just needpatience, the rest will come by itself.
</p>
<p>
 0 gegen Jugoslawien, da war ja wirklich Glück im Spiel. :When we beat Yugoslavia 2-0, we were really lucky.
</p>
<p>
 Was the defensive tacticreally right?
</p>
<p>
 And wasit right to take out the good Klodt for Rahn?
</p>
<p>
Rahn scored a goal, all right, but how important is he really?
</p>
<p>
 You have it a littleeasier than I do.
</p>
<p>
Your game and that of your colleagues starts when ours is over.
</p>
<p>
But since we won, I think I did everything right.
</p>
<p>
 Should Jupp Posipal really defend inthe semifinal
</p>
<p>
 really defend against Austria?
</p>
<p>
 This is how it is planned.
</p>
<p>
 You must not!
</p>
<p>
 Jupp is completely out ofshape! Neither we
</p>
<p>
 nor the home country haveany understanding for this.
</p>
<p>
 Posipal defends against Austria.
</p>
<p>
 We want to become strong ondefense.
</p>
<p>
 Whether that is correct, wewill see.
</p>
<p>
 Have you been in theshaking game....
</p>
<p>
against Yugoslavia that it would finally be over?
</p>
<p>
 How did you feel after thegame?
</p>
<p>
 I don't know anything like that.
</p>
<p>
 After the game is before the game.
</p>
<p>
 Bruno, what are you doing?
</p>
<p>
 Nothing.
</p>
<p>
 Packing.
</p>
<p>
 Where do you want to go?
</p>
<p>
 I can't tell you that.
</p>
<p>
 But why do you want to leave?
</p>
<p>
 Oh, come on, you know that.
</p>
<p>
 With me and Dad, it justdoesn't work out.
</p>
<p>
 I'm sure it will get bettersoon.
</p>
<p>
 I want to get out of hereanyway, you know?
</p>
<p>
 I finally want to dosomething useful.
</p>
<p>
 All right. I'm going to Berlin.
</p>
<p>
 To East Berlin.
</p>
<p>
 To the East Zone?
</p>
<p>
 This is the capital
</p>
<p>
 of the German DemocraticRepublic!
</p>
<p>
 There, all people are equal.
</p>
<p>
 There are no rich and no poor, no unemployedand freedom of speech!
</p>
<p>
 There's no such thing.
</p>
<p>
 Yes. From what I've heard, theycould use
</p>
<p>
 still need a few good musicians.
</p>
<p>
 I don't want you to go.
</p>
<p>
 Hey, kid!
</p>
<p>
 You are the best man in thefamily.
</p>
<p>
 I know that.
</p>
<p>
 And I'm counting on you.
</p>
<p>
 I can do that, can't I?
</p>
<p>
 This one is for dad and mom.
</p>
<p>
 Don't worry, there's nothing bad in it, just the truth. Butwait!
</p>
<p>
 I need a week's head start,okay?
</p>
<p>
 You have to promise me that.
</p>
<p>
 Come here.
</p>
<p>
 Huh?
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Lubanski.
</p>
<p>
 Good day, Reverend.
</p>
<p>
 Excuse me, do you have a moment?
</p>
<p>
 But of course. Come.
</p>
<p>
 Who would have thought that?
</p>
<p>
 We are in the semifinals! And aboy
</p>
<p>
 from here scored a goal.
</p>
<p>
 Yes.
</p>
<p>
 Is incredible.
</p>
<p>
 In the semifinals, it'sagainst Austria.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, that will be atleast as difficult.
</p>
<p>
 Actually, I'm nothere to talk about soccer.
</p>
<p>
 Of course not. Sorry.
</p>
<p>
 I just don't know what to doanymore.
</p>
<p>
 Nothing is the way it used to be.
</p>
<p>
 I try to do everythingright.
</p>
<p>
 But that only makes things worse.
</p>
<p>
 Now Bruno is gone, too.
</p>
<p>
 I know very many prisonersof war.
</p>
<p>
 Most of the returnees
</p>
<p>
 are ashamed of their time in misery.
</p>
<p>
 Theyexclude their families, pretend to be strong.
</p>
<p>
 In reality, they are afraid to show what captivityhas done to them.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Didn't you get anything to eat?
</p>
<p>
 Nope.
</p>
<p>
 We have not.
</p>
<p>
 It's like this.
</p>
<p>
 Where we never had enoughto eat was....
</p>
<p>
 The Russians had nothing themselves.
</p>
<p>
 We had everything...
</p>
<p>
 devastated and burned.
</p>
<p>
 I was able to reach with my fingers
</p>
<p>
 around my thigh.
</p>
<p>
 (Football commentary on the radio)
</p>
<p>
 The mostimportant thing was to be able to get up in the morning.
</p>
<p>
 Then the first thing you didwas to touch your comrade
</p>
<p>
 next to you to see if he wasstill warm.
</p>
<p>
 Whether he is still alive.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe one could
</p>
<p>
 his boots could still be used.
</p>
<p>
 At some point, the Russians sent theincapacitated
</p>
<p>
 were sent home by the Russians.
</p>
<p>
Many of us wanted to make ourselves sick because we wanted to gohome.
</p>
<p>
 They drank salt water...
</p>
<p>
 and died of it.
</p>
<p>
 Those who did not yet have dystrophy, those who could stillwalk, they put them
</p>
<p>
 into work brigades.
</p>
<p>
 They sent me as a specialist
</p>
<p>
 They sent me to Siberia as aspecialist in open-cast mining.
</p>
<p>
 Haven't you ever thought abouthome?
</p>
<p>
 I...
</p>
<p>
 I didn't believe in homeanymore.
</p>
<p>
 I have not thought about youanymore.
</p>
<p>
 I only counted the winters...
</p>
<p>
 and thought about food.
</p>
<p>
 From time to time the farmers
</p>
<p>
 gave us something.
</p>
<p>
 And on the way back aRussian took me home.
</p>
<p>
 took me home.
</p>
<p>
 He showed me a picture.
</p>
<p>
 With such a...
</p>
<p>
 black ribbon around it.
</p>
<p>
 It was a picture of his son.
</p>
<p>
 I know I have not alwaysbehaved
</p>
<p>
 not always behaved properly.
</p>
<p>
 But...
</p>
<p>
 I just don't know my way aroundanymore.
</p>
<p>
 It's all so foreign here.
</p>
<p>
 And with Bruno, that hadbeen my fault.
</p>
<p>
 Bruno couldn't stand it hereanymore.
</p>
<p>
 He had to replace you for so long.
</p>
<p>
 I think now he justwanted to leave.
</p>
<p>
 He is oldenough to make his own decisions.
</p>
<p>
 But here are three others.
</p>
<p>
 They need you.
</p>
<p>
 A gift corner kick forGermany!
</p>
<p>
 Wouldn'tsurprise me if the 4th goal would fall now.
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter shoots withhis right foot.
</p>
<p>
 Deflected. Goal. Goal!
</p>
<p>
 Goal for Germany.
</p>
<p>
 Goal for Germany!
</p>
<p>
 Ottmar Walter, Ottmar Walter!
</p>
<p>
 1 für Deutschland. : 4 : 1 for Germany.
</p>
<p>
 I am speechless!
</p>
<p>
 (Austrian reporter) So you can see, if youlook at the expressions now, as far as you can see them from thisdistance, that our players are already resigning.
</p>
<p>
 It almost seems... Let's leaveit!
</p>
<p>
 Happel has a ball now...
</p>
<p>
 once again presented to theGermans.
</p>
<p>
 What's going on today?
</p>
<p>
 Wagner to Probst, Probst forward
</p>
<p>
 to Körner 2, who tries atrick.
</p>
<p>
It fails. Grain 2 to Stojaspal, who hooks away to grain 2...
</p>
<p>
 the one hook once again toProbst.
</p>
<p>
 Probst shoots and hits the grass!
</p>
<p>
 Quite apart from this, Körner2
</p>
<p>
 and Stojaspal should haveshot long ago!
</p>
<p>
 Speedis not witchcraft, as the Germans show us today!
</p>
<p>
 But we are too slow.
</p>
<p>
 Stojaspal on the ball,wants to put Probst in, but he is in Liebrich's hands as if he were ababy...
</p>
<p>
 and the Liebrich his mother.
</p>
<p>
 So, who do we get in the final?
</p>
<p>
 That interests you?
</p>
<p>
What was that the other day about the 24 people chasing a ball?
</p>
<p>
 Oh, the other day! The otherday I was still
</p>
<p>
 an ignorant child. So?
</p>
<p>
 Hungary.
</p>
<p>
 They beat Uruguay in overtime
</p>
<p>
 2 geschlagen. - Schöne Bescherung. : 4 : 2 in overtime. -Nice gift.
</p>
<p>
 Those wild goal scorersagain.
</p>
<p>
 We canhope to lose by only single digits this time.
</p>
<p>
 We're not losing again!
</p>
<p>
 That would not be fair.
</p>
<p>
 Good idea. We simply applyfor...
</p>
<p>
 at Fifa a fair outcome!
</p>
<p>
 All right, wise guy.
</p>
<p>
 Wir gewinnen! : I'm going to tell yousomething : We're going to win!
</p>
<p>
 And make shashlik out of theHungarians.
</p>
<p>
 You mean goulash, honey.
</p>
<p>
 When I say shish kebab,that's what I mean.
</p>
<p>
 Good. What do we bet?
</p>
<p>
 If we everhave kids, I get to pick the names.
</p>
<p>
 If Germany wins.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwise, I'll pick the names.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;And that is why I consider you
</p>
<p>
 the legitimate successor toFritz Walter.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck, yours, CarmenBallmann.&quot;
</p>
<p>
 Well?
</p>
<p>
Carmen Ballmann. Admit it, Horst, you wrote those yourself.
</p>
<p>
 This is a giant soccer expert, there's no doubt aboutit!
</p>
<p>
 Look at our little ones. I bet we disturbed them atnight prayer.
</p>
<p>
 Wasn't that guy there today
</p>
<p>
 in the square with the guide dog?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, exactly!
</p>
<p>
 You're not so good at thinking, so I'll say it againslowly :
</p>
<p>
 We are in the final!
</p>
<p>
 Afterwards you will be drapedin gold
</p>
<p>
 and carried off the square inpalanquins!
</p>
<p>
 Yes, and men like me
</p>
<p>
 they carve in stone later.
</p>
<p>
 Or in the frying pan, if you donot soon
</p>
<p>
 soon, if you don't put a ballin the goal again.
</p>
<p>
 1. : Exactly. Where are your goals? 6: 1.
</p>
<p>
 Everyone had a go today, didn'tyou?
</p>
<p>
 You were just picking your nose!
</p>
<p>
 Come on, Fritz, let's go toToni's.
</p>
<p>
 He still appreciates realguys.
</p>
<p>
 And Ihave to pull his ears out because of the goal against.
</p>
<p>
 Sleep well, boys.
</p>
<p>
 In no case eight pieces again.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwisethey'll say Turkey was too weak, they were lucky against Yugoslavia,and Austria had a bad day!
</p>
<p>
 3 könnte man leben. : You could live with a 4 : 3.
</p>
<p>
 The ultimate on Sunday would be if it goes into overtime!
</p>
<p>
 But now I've had enough!
</p>
<p>
 Why should we lose at all?
</p>
<p>
 I would love to win,but....
</p>
<p>
 &quot;But...!&quot; I just haveto say it :
</p>
<p>
 Take an example from the boss.
</p>
<p>
 He's just talking about howhe's going to fill up
</p>
<p>
 the hut full. He's right!
</p>
<p>
 I would like to thank you onceagain
</p>
<p>
 for this unscheduledconversation.
</p>
<p>
 We are also unscheduled
</p>
<p>
 in the final.
</p>
<p>
 Is there such a thing
</p>
<p>
 like a secret of thisGerman team?
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter. : It hasa head, a thinker and a leader : Fritz Walter.
</p>
<p>
 Without him, real successwould be unthinkable.
</p>
<p>
 Ifhe had been injured early on, we wouldn't be sitting here now.
</p>
<p>
 Herberger! Herberger!
</p>
<p>
 Bravo! Bravo!
</p>
<p>
Strange! These are the same people you were talking to just two weeksago....
</p>
<p>
 openly hostile, because youlost the 1st game against us
</p>
<p>
 against us lost from theoutset.
</p>
<p>
 No,no, I had a strategy that would lead to victory.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately, the
</p>
<p>
 failed particularly miserably.
</p>
<p>
 I don'twant to sound presumptuous, Mr. Herberger, but....
</p>
<p>
 Do you actually see a realchance
</p>
<p>
 of winning against Hungary?
</p>
<p>
 If the sunshines on Sunday, Hungary will be world champion.
</p>
<p>
 Then we can't stop you.
</p>
<p>
 We are clearly inferior in terms ofplay.
</p>
<p>
 But what if it rains?
</p>
<p>
 Fritz Walter weather.
</p>
<p>
 Then the ground becomes heavy.
</p>
<p>
 Then... we have a chance.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Matthias.
</p>
<p>
 Matthias, wake up. Come on, wake up!
</p>
<p>
 What is it?
</p>
<p>
 Get up. We're going for a ride.
</p>
<p>
 What kind of car is that?
</p>
<p>
 I borrowed it from the priest.
</p>
<p>
 (Matthias)
</p>
<p>
 Beautiful.
</p>
<p>
 Where are we going anyway?
</p>
<p>
 To Bern, for the final.
</p>
<p>
 What?
</p>
<p>
 You said yourself :
</p>
<p>
 Only whenyou're there does the boss win the important games.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Fucking shit!
</p>
<p>
 We lost the first game againstHungary
</p>
<p>
 3 verloren. Das hat sehr wehgetan. : with 8 : 3. That hurta lot.
</p>
<p>
 But as youall know, everything good and beautiful carries...
</p>
<p>
 already contain the seeds ofdestruction.
</p>
<p>
 And also vice versa.
</p>
<p>
 8 goals conceded.
</p>
<p>
 What do we learn from this?
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians are an exceptionalteam.
</p>
<p>
Undefeated for 4 years! Except Lorant, Kocsis, Bozsik and Puskas...
</p>
<p>
 there are only players in the teamwho don't know what it's like to lose with the national team.
</p>
<p>
 But that doesn'tmean it can't be done.
</p>
<p>
 Because...
</p>
<p>
 we also scored three goals!
</p>
<p>
 Sie sind anfällig. : That is, they are vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
 And that is here.
</p>
<p>
 'over on the left. Bozsik plays so offensively thatholes always open up behind him.
</p>
<p>
 We have to use this free space!
</p>
<p>
 Hans...
</p>
<p>
 This is especially true for you.
</p>
<p>
 Puskas is back on his feet.He is playing.
</p>
<p>
 He may be injured, but he'll be eager to playagainst us.
</p>
<p>
 Werner Liebrich will takecare of him.
</p>
<p>
But if we want to win the final, then we have to hit the Hungarians
</p>
<p>
 in their hearts.
</p>
<p>
 And this is not Puskas.
</p>
<p>
 That's Hidegkuti.
</p>
<p>
He's nominally a center forward, but he pulls the strings inmidfield!
</p>
<p>
 The game runs through him.
</p>
<p>
 He is the one to be eliminated.
</p>
<p>
 Horst! Cling to his heels.
</p>
<p>
 Bite down on him.
</p>
<p>
 I want this man
</p>
<p>
 dream about you tonight!
</p>
<p>
 We have a big tacticaladvantage.
</p>
<p>
 We know the playing strengthof the Hungarians.
</p>
<p>
 Sie kennen unsere nicht. : Only : They don't know ours.
</p>
<p>
 They don't even know howstrong we are!
</p>
<p>
 Theydon't know that we are strong enough to beat them.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Adi! Stoll already times on.
</p>
<p>
 Nothing better than that, Seppl.
</p>
<p>
 (Unintelligible conversations)
</p>
<p>
Comrades, now the guys have to show whether they are really men!
</p>
<p>
 Welost the war, we are also losing this endgame.
</p>
<p>
 Father!
</p>
<p>
 (engine stutters)
</p>
<p>
 I don't know what's going oneither.
</p>
<p>
 I think it's onlyrunning on two pots now.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (Cheers)
</p>
<p>
 (German National Anthem)
</p>
<p>
(Zimmermann) Germany in the World Cup final, that's a huge sensation!
</p>
<p>
 This is a real soccer miracle, but it came about quitenaturally.
</p>
<p>
 We owe it to the soccerintelligence
</p>
<p>
 and the perfection of ourplayers.
</p>
<p>
 And the game here is aboutto begin.
</p>
<p>
 1... : Therefore, no long introduction, but just thelineup, which Austria with 6 : 1...
</p>
<p>
 in the final round match :
</p>
<p>
 Turekfrom Düsseldorf in goal, Posipal from Hamburg and Kohlmeyer
</p>
<p>
 from Kaiserslautern indefense.
</p>
<p>
 The runners' row with Eckeland Liebrich
</p>
<p>
 from Kaiserslautern and Maifrom Fürth.
</p>
<p>
 In the forward line, Rahn fromEssen at right wing, Morlock, Nuremberg, at half right, then the twoWalter brothers
</p>
<p>
 from Kaiserslautern andSchäfer from Cologne.
</p>
<p>
 Just now referee Link
</p>
<p>
 from England has justblown the whistle for the match, incidentally the same referee whoblew the whistle for the 1st match against Hungary.
</p>
<p>
 What a shit! And so early!
</p>
<p>
 We don't stand a chanceanymore.
</p>
<p>
 Why aren't they paying attentionback there?
</p>
<p>
 If this continues, itwill be without me!
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter) Whatwe feared has come to pass.
</p>
<p>
 The lightning start of the Hungarians
</p>
<p>
 gave them the lead.
</p>
<p>
 0 geht das aus! Und wir Deutschen : 12 : 0 is the score! Andwe Germans
</p>
<p>
 are the fools again! That's it!
</p>
<p>
 It was a very stupid mishap.
</p>
<p>
 A silly coincidence.
</p>
<p>
 0 für Ungarn. : And still it's 2 : 0for Hungary.
</p>
<p>
 If it's a boy, his name is Rüdiger, if it's a girl,Roswitha.
</p>
<p>
 Roswitha?
</p>
<p>
 Roswitha?
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 Germany ahead! Germany ahead!
</p>
<p>
 (Exciting music)
</p>
<p>
 Go, men! Let's go now!
</p>
<p>
 Come on. Nothing is lost yet.
</p>
<p>
 Youknow, in captivity, I learned a trick.
</p>
<p>
 With theperformance, you know, you can do anything.
</p>
<p>
 Wealways imagined eating our fill.
</p>
<p>
 And if the hunger
</p>
<p>
didn't get to us too much, then it worked out wonderfully.
</p>
<p>
 You just have to close your eyes, then you can go anywhere,even to Bern.
</p>
<p>
 It's as if you were thereyourself.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, try it.
</p>
<p>
 (Unintelligible)
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter) Goal! Goal for Germany!
</p>
<p>
 What did I say?
</p>
<p>
 Maybe we can still make it
</p>
<p>
 to the second half, huh?
</p>
<p>
 1. Rahns Schuss wurde abgefälscht : 2 : 1. Rahn's shot wasdeflected
</p>
<p>
 by a Hungarian defender!
</p>
<p>
 Maxl Morlock threw himselfinto the path of the shot.
</p>
<p>
 andwith his last strength he pushes the ball past the Hungarian
</p>
<p>
 past the goalkeeper of theHungarians, Grosics.
</p>
<p>
 0, es steht nur noch 2 : 1, unddas sollte unserer Elf : Thank God, it is no longer 2 : 0, it isonly 2 : 1, and that should give our eleven
</p>
<p>
 now give courage andself-confidence.
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter)
</p>
<p>
 Goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 (Mattes)
</p>
<p>
 Goal! Goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 (Zimmermann) Goal by Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 2. : The score is 2 : 2.
</p>
<p>
 The game is even again.
</p>
<p>
 You never play.Morlock stands two or three times all alone in front of the goal, andyou slam the thing into the clouds!
</p>
<p>
 You better take care of yourdefense!
</p>
<p>
 I guess the first two wereguest gifts!
</p>
<p>
 We can't iron everythingout in front!
</p>
<p>
 Tell that to Kohli. He doesn't even know how toplay back to the goalkeeper.
</p>
<p>
 You're stuck on the line!
</p>
<p>
 Are you blind, you secretplaymaker?
</p>
<p>
 I'm running my lungs out, and you're just playing to Fritz!- Silence!
</p>
<p>
 Save your breath.
</p>
<p>
 You will need it!
</p>
<p>
 Haven't you realized it yet?
</p>
<p>
 We can become world championshere!
</p>
<p>
 And you're just bickering here.
</p>
<p>
 2! : The score is 2 : 2!
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians arefurious. In the 2nd half
</p>
<p>
 they'll be all over you again!
</p>
<p>
 So pay attention. You have toburn again
</p>
<p>
 burn for 45 minutes!
</p>
<p>
 Fight.Fight! One for all, all for one! Is that clear?
</p>
<p>
 Pretty exciting, huh?
</p>
<p>
 You can say.
</p>
<p>
 I wanted to apologize to you.
</p>
<p>
 You know, about the rabbits.
</p>
<p>
 Never mind.
</p>
<p>
 I just wanted that for Mom'sbirthday
</p>
<p>
 something real on the table.
</p>
<p>
 (Zimmermann) We are reporting from Bern.
</p>
<p>
 2. : At the beginning of the2nd half the score is 2 : 2.
</p>
<p>
 For Hungary scored Puskas and Ozibor,connecting and equalizing...
</p>
<p>
 for the Germans Morlock and Rahn.
</p>
<p>
 (Whistles from the audience)
</p>
<p>
 (whistle)
</p>
<p>
 (Carpenter) header from Buzanszki
</p>
<p>
 against the crossbar! That wasdangerous!
</p>
<p>
 That's as close as we're going to get.
</p>
<p>
 Come on, we'll meet back here.Run!
</p>
<p>
 You have to come with me, Dad.
</p>
<p>
 They can't win without you.
</p>
<p>
 You'll be faster without me. Go!
</p>
<p>
(Zimmermann) Throw-in Hungary, played forward. Lantos shoots!
</p>
<p>
 Liebrich saves. Another follow-upshot.
</p>
<p>
 Kocsis on the left wing!
</p>
<p>
 Save! Save! Save!
</p>
<p>
 Defense of Turek!
</p>
<p>
 Turek, you are one hell of a guy.
</p>
<p>
 Turek, you are a soccer god!
</p>
<p>
 Please excuse the enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
 The soccer laymen
</p>
<p>
 Es ist heutewirklich : will say we are crazy, but remember : today is really
</p>
<p>
 Germany's soccer day, and Hidegkuti's shot, firedfrom 3 meters full...
</p>
<p>
 on theGerman goal, is blocked by Turek for a corner!
</p>
<p>
 6 minutes left in the WankdorfStadium
</p>
<p>
 in Bern. No one is wavering.
</p>
<p>
 The rain is pelting down! It's heavy, but ofcourse the spectators persevere!
</p>
<p>
 A soccer world cup is every 4 years, and when do you see such afinal match
</p>
<p>
 so balanced, so gripping?Foul on Rahn!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (whistle)
</p>
<p>
 (Player) Allez hopp, Boss!
</p>
<p>
(Zimmermann) Again and again Bozsik, the right runner of theHungarians, on the ball.
</p>
<p>
 He lost the ball againstSchäfer!
</p>
<p>
 Schäfer crossed to the inside.Header.
</p>
<p>
 Averted!
</p>
<p>
 Rahn should shoot fromthe background.
</p>
<p>
 Rahn shoots!
</p>
<p>
 Goal! Goal! Goal!
</p>
<p>
 Goal!
</p>
<p>
 2 für Deutschland im Spiel gegen Ungarn, das seit 41/2 Jahren...: 3 : 2 for Germany in the match against Hungary, which for 41/2years...
</p>
<p>
 has no longer lost aninternational match!
</p>
<p>
 But the second handmoves so slowly!
</p>
<p>
 I stare across as if spellbound.
</p>
<p>
 Go faster! But he doesn't, he goesahead with the precision that is prescribed for him.
</p>
<p>
 Now another minute and a halfor two minutes.
</p>
<p>
 2. : Germany leads 3 : 2.
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians arecompletely out of their minds!
</p>
<p>
 Puskas on the ball in the center circle.
</p>
<p>
 Now the Hungarians have a chance!
</p>
<p>
 Play off to the right hill.Ozibor.
</p>
<p>
 Now a shot. Held by Toni!
</p>
<p>
 And the 45th minute is completed.
</p>
<p>
 It can only be an aftermath of
</p>
<p>
 one minute, but there isdanger!
</p>
<p>
 The Hungarians on the right wing.
</p>
<p>
 Now Fritz Walter has the ball...
</p>
<p>
 hit over the sidelines andout of bounds.
</p>
<p>
 Who can blame him?
</p>
<p>
 Throw-in for Hungary, takento Bozsik.
</p>
<p>
 (Final whistle)
</p>
<p>
 Off! Off! Off! Off!
</p>
<p>
 The game is over!
</p>
<p>
 Germany is the world champion!
</p>
<p>
 2 Toren! : Beats Hungary with 3 : 2 goals!
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 (music)
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann, they're squeezing us todeath!
</p>
<p>
 What do you want me to do?
</p>
<p>
 Ich soll in diesen Zug! : Ahrens said clearly : Ishould get on this train!
</p>
<p>
 But I can't keep up.
</p>
<p>
 Why not, Annette?
</p>
<p>
 I can't possibly do that toDante.
</p>
<p>
 Who is Dante?
</p>
<p>
 But you should really knowthat.
</p>
<p>
 This is your son.
</p>
<p>
 My son?
</p>
<p>
 Dante?
</p>
<p>
 I get to pick the names.
</p>
<p>
 Already forgotten?
</p>
<p>
 Annette! I'm going crazy.You are...
</p>
<p>
 How do you know it's going tobe a boy?
</p>
<p>
 That's what I feel.
</p>
<p>
 Annette.
</p>
<p>
 Annette, you are wonderful.
</p>
<p>
 You know what?
</p>
<p>
 I don't care about this train!
</p>
<p>
 What's the point?
</p>
<p>
 Don't argue. Family comes first.
</p>
<p>
 Besides, you need to take it easynow.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry. Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry.
</p>
<p>
 (train signal)
</p>
<p>
 Hey, kid, your guy is wanted.
</p>
<p>
 Isn't this place a madhouse?
</p>
<p>
 Sensational!
</p>
<p>
 We are world champions!
</p>
<p>
 Thank you.
</p>
<p>
 Sorry. You are not allowedin here.
</p>
<p>
 I was already on the trainthe whole time.
</p>
<p>
 I just went to get my boy.
</p>
<p>
 Oh, and who are you?
</p>
<p>
 Ackermann. Süddeutsche Zeitung.
</p>
<p>
 Is he?
</p>
<p>
 Jesus, Mattes. What are youdoing here?
</p>
<p>
 I'm going crazy.
</p>
<p>
 Two bottles of beer. Andice cold.
</p>
<p>
 You said you couldn't win the biggames
</p>
<p>
 you can't win without me.
</p>
<p>
 That's right. And wasn't Iright?
</p>
<p>
 Tell me, are you actuallyall alone?
</p>
<p>
 No, my father brought me.
</p>
<p>
 Lubanski.
</p>
<p>
Pleased to meet you. Rahn. Looks like we owe the victory to you.
</p>
<p>
 Yes. Respect for your goal.
</p>
<p>
 I would like to have your nerves.
</p>
<p>
 Go on in, I'll be right back.
</p>
<p>
 I need to have a quicktoast with someone, okay?
</p>
<p>
 Boss? Here, justbrought me a real buddy brought me.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, some real beer.
</p>
<p>
 I thought I'd share that withyou.
</p>
<p>
 Boss, you will never change.
</p>
<p>
 But if anyone can do it,you can.
</p>
<p>
 Who do we have here?
</p>
<p>
 Fits like a glove. Willste have?
</p>
<p>
 Toni,come here. Some girls want your autograph. - Girls?
</p>
<p>
 Where.
</p>
<p>
 And what do you think ofhim? Boss, I mean.
</p>
<p>
 He's a great act.
</p>
<p>
 No one can compete with him.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, you do. You can stand upto him.
</p>
<p>
 Wow.
</p>
<p>
 That's a great compliment.
</p>
<p>
From Bruno. He made me promise not to give it to you earlier.
</p>
<p>
 Dad, what's wrong?
</p>
<p>
 Bruno...
</p>
<p>
 He wishes us all the best and writes that we can visithim anytime.
</p>
<p>
 What must you think of yourfather?
</p>
<p>
 Sitting here crying like alittle child.
</p>
<p>
 You know, I think German boys
</p>
<p>
 can also cry sometimes.
</p>
<p>
 (music)
